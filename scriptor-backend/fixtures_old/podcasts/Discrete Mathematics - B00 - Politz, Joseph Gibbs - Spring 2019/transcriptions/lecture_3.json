Are there any other questions?  People are getting comfortable getting ready for their clickers. Let's start thinking back to the first couple of classes we had today or we had this week when have numbers popped up.  Tell if I just had the room, why do we see the number in class?  Yeah, so we used to code liking or disliking sew-in are representations of the ratings of people's preferences about movies of numbers showed up.  On the front in the middle of the room.  numbers  There was a 25.  There was a 15.  Soda optimization. So when we're trying to talk about this parameter that we're trying to optimize often it represented by a number. So we want the fewest number of coins.  So we've got a number of coins that's counting cool.  The movie ratings cool. So when we were comparing the patterns of likes and dislikes and we are calculating the distance between two sets of preferences. So we are comparing distances between and tuples and to do that. We were calculating the Mac Store. We were calculating square root of sums of squares. And so those functions gave us numbers and some of those numbers were  Like zeros and ones and twos with some of those numbers were also like square root of 2 square root of 3. So when were thinking about these problems that we're trying to solve whether it be Netflix recommendations are optimizing coin changing. We are using numbers to help guide our Solutions. And so if we want a code out these Solutions are algorithms. We need to represent numbers in our computer. And so part of the multiple representations theme of the course is to think about how we're going to represent these numbers in our computers and different contexts call for different representations. So as human beings with ten fingers and ten toes the number system that we typically used throughout our life is the decimal base 10 system.  But when it comes to representing numbers in our computers in circuitry where our representation is based on the voltage level in our system, it's easier to just have a threshold that distinguishes between just two values on and off and so we want to translate a representation to base to where we only have two possible values 0 and 1 off and on.  So in today's class in a Monday as well will be talkin about translating between representations of numbers from one form to another and first of all, we'll start with thinking about representing positive numbers. So many of the examples that we seen so far have whole numbers that are greater than 0 those are positive integers, but then on Monday we'll extend to thinking about what about representing zero or negative numbers or even things like the square root of 2 so far so good.  Cool. Alright, so in the pre-class reading you thought about positional representation based representation. I'm going to leave this side up for now, but I'd like you to First Direct your attention to the top of the worksheet. So y'all should have a copy of this and the definition of base B representation is at the very top. I like to just warm up by doing a couple of examples. So where the people around you and with the help of the Tudors if you'd like if you could write down the number 142 using some of the bases in the table or the number 17, if you want to start smaller in base ten translated to base 2 8 or 16 and I got the definition of top you have the pre-class reading to guide you. We're going to jump in and doing some examples for the next five minutes or so nice to work with people around you and let's fill in the stable.  Get a copy of the worksheet.  tomato confit  behind you. Thank you.  Anyone need help getting started.  blue together  tell me how can I start it?  Show us some people are going to start it. I'm hearing powers of 2, so I'll fill in this table here as a reference for your powers of 2 and powers of 3 that you can use.  Are let's come together and let's do one of these examples as a group and then we can extend those later. So let's start with the number 17 in base 10.  And the Heart of positional representation or base B representation of positive integers is that we wants to think of writing our number 17 as sums of multiples of powers of 10. So when we think of writing 17 in decimal, we're writing it as 1 * 10 + 7 * 1 + 10 + 1 are powers of 10.  So in a sense, we've got these columns that increase in value from right to left. So the rightmost column is the least significant call of the the lightest color. It's the ones place.  And then the next column over is the next power of 10. It's the tens place. So similarly when we switch basis to say base to we're going to think of our columns going from right to left increasing in weight. So the rightmost column will still be the ones place cuz that's two to the zero and then we'll have a column for the tooz place. That's two of the one we'll have a column for the fours place because that's two squared cetera et cetera, et cetera.  And so if we want to write 17 in binary or face to we need to think of expressing 17 as sums of powers of 2.  How do we do that?  How could you write it as a sum of powers of 2 when the powers of two are over here?  Cool. So the greatest power to the 15 to 17 to 16 and so we got 16 then the remaining Valley. We still need to represent his one and that's the power of two so we can express 17 as 16 + 1  And we noticed it's 16 is 2 to the 4 + 1 is 2 to the 0 and so in this positional base to representation will have A1 the coefficient in the ones place. We don't have any choose we don't have any fours. We don't have any dates and we have 116.  Any questions about that?  So far so good.  All right. So let's do one more which which other cell in the table. Would you like to get together?  Lexia 17 and another base or 142  142 let's maybe do 142.  What's 6 in binary fission got all those ice powers of two written down three just for fun. Alright, 142. We want to ride it and base 3.  So what do we need to do?  Yeah, so we need to think of the greatest power of 3 that will fit into 142 cuz that will tell us how to decompose 142 into multiples of powers of 3 and 27/5 until 1:42. But so does 3 to the 4th, which is 81 if we were to multiply 81 by 3 again to get three to the fifth we get 243. That's too big.  So if we're thinking about a hundred and forty-two as some volume that we need to fill we can use.  A 3-2 4th to fill in some amount of it. So that's 81 worth and what do we have left after we filled 81?  61  So this was 81. We got 61 my scale to get off but we've got the picture and so how do we represent 61 using powers of 3?  Yeah, we can use a 27.  And if we do 60 1-27 we're doing some arithmetic 1-7 is for we're borrowing a one from the 6-3 bus 34 left and that means that we can fit another power of cubic power of three in there so we can use another 27.  And what will have to represent now is 34 - 27 that's seven more.  And 7 well, that's too small to fit another 27 in Steven too small to put a 9in but we can put a couple of Threes in so we can use a couple of 3.  and a one  this picture decompose 142 as 3 to the fourth + 2/3 cubed + 2/3 + a 1  and so we can translate this decomposition to the base 3 representation. We're in the base true representation. We're keeping track of the coefficients associated with each power of 3 in order. So we've got the coefficient 1 and the threes place we bought the coefficients to in the nines Place. We've got the coefficients 0 and the 27th.  Play we have a two and in the 80 ones place. We have a coefficient 1.  Any questions about this?  Awesome. So if you're looking at the definition of the base expansion the observation here is that the number of times were allowed to use each power of the base is at most b - 1  So here's another way to think about it and let's go work through the clicker question.  Let's think about what are some constraints about dispositional representation. And so take a look at this question, please and then vote.  and when PA  Absolutely. Thank you.  And last votes, please.  3  2  and one  and let's talk to another we're not a consent at this point to speaking with your neighbors and arguing about why each of a b and c is true or false is really good practice to take a minute, please.  questions questions questions  Make a super fun. But which one is which?  Any questions about it so far?  When you come to a consensus with the people around you let's revoked.  All right. Let's get those group ocean, please.  So you want to click it again to reflect your opinion now after discussing with your neighbors?  And I'll close with whole industry.  2  and one  and it's really interesting. Here are the results at the moment.  So a lot of us are feeling like there's at least two of the a b and c which are correct, but we maybe are not sure if all three are right. So let's go through the three zones in the room and talked about each of the options a b and c so start with over this side of the room. What y'all think about a  Cool, so you're saying that it wouldn't be possible to have any negative exponents because if we have a negative exponent we'd get a decimal. So we got a decimal number we get a fractional component something that is between 0 and 1 and here representing positive integers. Anything people would like to add or disagree agree jungle for  Okay, cool, so is that in a the claim is at the exponent of powers of ten in the summer all positive the counterexample That was supposed is a really good country south of why we can't have negative exponents but there's a third category as well for integers so exponents if they're going to be integers could be negative zero or positive and in our base expansions here we are allowing zero exponents that's the ones place and so a isn't correct because we've talked about strictly positive we could fix a so a fixed version of a would-be to say that the exponents  Powers of ten in the some are all non-negative.  And that would clarify that we're allowing Serie. Awesome. All right. What about B?  Yeah, so when we're thinking of expanding a positive integers in decimal representation that's going to be a finite representation our numbers and they have some valleys and finite values. So there's going to be a highest power of 10 to 6 in them. And that's going to be our highest exponent then what about see over here?  nothing  think about the coefficients whether the coefficient coefficient are non-negative and less than 10.  So when we write out numbers do we have do we ever have negatives inside our expansion?  No cool, and do we ever have like 11 as a single unit inside the expansion know so she is also correct.  All right any questions about these properties?  All right. So Daddy was a correct answer and he was really this tricky Edge case really to point out the difference between saying that something is positive and say that something is non-  Oh, okay. Cool. So in part C we talked about the coefficients not the exponents and soap when we talked with the coefficients were talking with the number that when multiplied by a power of 10 by and those numbers are between 0 and 9 so that goes back to the observation about the definition of the base B expansion and the possible values for each air the numbers between 0 and B -1 inclusive. So the whole numbers between 0 and b - 1  the questions about that  excellent. So here we are saying that for a particular base and a particular positive integer the base B expansion of n is this representation of a coefficient and that suggests that there's a unique representation now proving uniqueness takes a little bit of work in about five weeks. We'll have all the tools that we need to prove uniqueness of Base B expansion at this point. We don't yet have the techniques to prove it but it is true. So when we are extracting the highest power of the base that fits inside the number there will be a unique answer and that will determine the rest of the coefficients uniquely as well.  Good point as well. So when we look at this highest power, I sometimes it will just be one copy of that highest power sometimes will be able to fit multiple as we're doing the expansion. Absolutely another great Point already. So let's just probe this idea a little bit further with this next clicker question and think about if we were told it 1401 with a base B expansion for a number what base could this expansion be in?  Last votes, please.  3  2  and 1 are and the vast majority of people are saying more than one of your Bob and that's absolutely correct. So take a minute flex your expansion muscles and write down what number were representing and each of the valid basis here. So we're going to be around you the Tudors as well, which numbers are being represented.  questions so far  3 questions so far  So let's come together and this part of the room over here, please what number are we representing? If this is a binary or base 2 expansion?  We can't it can't possibly be one why not because there's a four so far is not less than 2 so it can't be used in a colorful as a coefficient in a binary expansion of a number.  All right middle of the room. What number are we representing? If this is an octal representation of a number base 8.  769 that don't number you came up with this well  1 * 8 ^ 3 + 4 * 8 ^ 2 + 0 * 8 + 1 and there was a calculation here. What was it?  Some number some big number we can calculate it and get 768 that doesn't seem right. Why does that not seem right?  The plus one they're so what's really nice about doing these these representations is that we could ask ourselves through these make sense. So why am I worrying about 768?  cuz it's not an odd number and if I representation ends in a 1  and our base is even then the number should be odd because all of the powers of 8 are even and now we've added one to it.  Okay, so I owe here and we always want to be skeptical even when it's on a slide and be making sure the answers make sense here so we can compute out 1 * 8 cubed + 4 * 8 squared + 1 + 1 probably got a slightly different number.  Alright, so similarly we could compute out the what number were representing in decimal with a digits 1401 or in hexadecimal with the symbols 51 to 11401.  Add an H bass we're interpreting the value or the weight of each column differently because those waist corresponds to powers of the base.  Some questions so far.  769 okay. I was only off by one. Thank you. So it should be 769.  Thank you, because we need that plus one.  What's a question so far?  All right, there's a table in the worksheet of the possible symbols that we might have in a base B expansion when B is one of the most commonly used basis so binary ternary octal decimal hexadecimal and hexadecimal to a little different from the rest and that if we're working in base 16, then are coefficients could have value 0 1 2 3 all the way up to 10 11 12 13 14 or 50 and so for a coefficient, we only have space in a representation for one symbol because each column has a way to it so we can only put a symbol in a single column.  So if we're wanting to represent the coefficient that supposed to have value 10 or 11. We can't use two columns. We want to just do the single column. And so we have special symbols of the symbol represents the value 10 the symbol B represents the value 11 Etc. And so that's why you'll start seeing some letters when we've got hexadecimal representations of numbers say if an RGB codes for colors on on the web and in other places that use hexadecimal  any questions  Alrighty, so at this point we hopefully have a good sense of the definitions of bases and four specific examples. We can look at a base B expansion of a number and write it as a sum of multiples of powers of the base and so come up with a decimal value that's being represented and we had some examples where we started with a decimal value and we wanted to ride in a particular base, but it would be nice to have an algorithm to convert between bases and that maybe it's hard. So it's worth thinking about together and in this kind of algorithm now, we're at the back of the worksheet if you're following along  What we'd like to do.  is for a given positive integer n and a given base a positive integer greater than 1 be we'd like to Output the base B representation of  And in order to do that, basically what we're outputting is a sequence of coefficients because we know what value each of those coefficients carries by virtue of its position in the reference in the representation. So if we knew what the length of the expansion was, we're going to call back Kay and what each of the coefficients are going to be in order then we'll have specified the base B expansion of that.  So that's the output of what we like for algorithm to be and so we want to think of how we're going to specify this algorithm and over the last couple of days we talked about how algorithms can be specified in English. They can be specified in pseudocode. They could be programmed into Java for example, and so we're going to practice with these different ways of talking about algorithms.  All right now.  Feels like a bit of a lie.  Because right now we got the input end and probably that's going to be in decimal cuz that's like the typical representation. We have a number from decimal to a base B.  But in the previous slide I kind of promised that we would go between bases.  So, how can we?  Fulfill this promise if we had have an algorithm from going from decimal to base B.  What if you have two bases that we want to convert between  Say we want to go from base B1.  Debase, me, too.  How do we do it?  Cool. So the algorithm so we're going to talk about in the next few slides tell us how to go from decimal to be to how do we go from B1 to decimal?  Yeah, the other way so in a sense what we're doing is using the definition.  So the definition that we have four base expansions, this one tells us how to go from the coefficients base B to the value of the number that's being represented. So we could apply that definition think of the base b 1 expansion as a sum of multiples of powers of Base be one right that out in decimal and then see that into the algorithms that we're going to look at.  Sunny Sands  Alrighty, so let's look at some of those algorithms and one of those algorithms is exactly the one that was suggested when we were doing the examples on the board. And that was this idea of find the highest power. So think of the biggest measuring cup of volume that we could pour into our to first and then calculate the remaining volume. We need to fill and fill in those coefficients.  Selfish approach starts at the leftmost coefficient starts at the highest weight call up and then Works down.  And so now what I like us to do is think about writing this algorithm in terms of some pseudocode and in particular we have to think about what it means to find that highest power a b that will fit in or if we want to think about the length of the coefficient. That's the next power of be  that was actually already calculated this k  on Wednesday  So there's a nice mathematical function that tells us about a number and then the highest power of another number that fits inside it and that's the logarithm function.  So on Wednesday, we talked about logarithm base to but in this situation we want to think about the logarithm base B. And so I'd like you to look at the worksheet on the top left corner and there is an algorithm there but is trying to calculate the logarithm base b or the integer part of it, but it's wrong. So take a minute the people around you and figure out what we need to do to edit that pseudocode so that it calculates the integer part of the logarithm base B.  Alright, let's come together.  So in this algorithm that calculates the integer part of log base B, we're given n and be as inputs. We start our counter. Our that's going to store the results as having values 0 and then we have this Loop while and is greater than one where we income at a counter are buy one and then we divide which store update the value of n by the result of dividing and by 2 as integers, and then we keep on going.  So what do we need to fix there? So we actually let get log base B I go fart.  Yes, exactly. So we need to think about NTSB what we're doing when we're calculating log base B is we're figuring out how many times we can divide and Bybee?  And still get integer values so and div 2 should be replaced by.  And Dave B.  And when we do that we can now use that algorithm to calculate the highest power of be the fits inside n and that's going to be the weight of the left-most column in our base B expansion. Now, it's the weight of the left-most column in our base B expansion is  B to the log  Base B of n then we're going to have another column next to another column exit all the way to be to the zero. And so the total number of call us is going to be this + 1 log base B of n + 1 because we have a column 400 exponent 1 exponents to exponents all the way up to log base B of n there's a total of log base B of n + 1 many columns.  And so that's why in our algorithm to calculate the base B expansion. We set the length of this expansion to be log base B of n + 1.  questions so far  All right.  So in tracing the rest of the pseudocode.  We're doing something a little bit familiar. You'll notice as we look at the pseudocode that it's kind of similar to the greedy algorithm we had for coin changing because what we're doing is taking our current value you can think of it as the measuring cup that were using to fill in the volume into this cylinder the graduated cylinder and we're pouring as much as we can each time.  So as we don't overflow so wild be the amount of value that we're trying to represent is greater than or equal to the current power of be that we're looking at we use as much of that power that we can so we're incrementing the coefficient in that column.  And decreasing the value we still need to represent. So in line 7, we're incrementing R coefficient in line 8 were saying how much more of the number do we still need to represent?  And then we see if we can still represent that value with our current power of be or whether we need to go to the next column in which case we can come in Thai  So what I recommend that you do in the privacy of your own home is trace this algorithm for the base 3 expansion of 17 can make sure you understand how each of the variables update but it should feel very similar to how we calculated say the base 3 expansion of the number that we had on the board.  What I think is really cool is that there's a completely separate other algorithm that gives us the very same answer and it's an example of a non greedy approach to solving this problem.  So the first approach was very greedy and that we were trying to represent as much of the number as we could at each step and we went from the left-most column all the way to the right.  This approach that something very different. It asked us to go from right to left where we're finding the smallest the coefficient first, then the next smallest then the next smallest etcetera.  And there's a question we might as well like how on Earth are we going to do that? We don't know ahead of time that we'll have space here for exactly one of the ones and two of the threes. So how do we know ahead of time what those coefficients will be?  And a trick here the Insight in this algorithm to is that we can decompose the expansion into two parts that are really reminiscent of what we do in long division.  If you think back to Monday and that's really big table of definitions and I really big table of definitions. We had the two components of integer division div and mod.  Until we think about dividing our number n that we're trying to represent by be our base less you then.  Here is D equals to be if our original number n had a face B expansion with a ones place Abby's place to be squares place at cetera all of the columns that weren't the ones place have a factor of B in them.  So we could factor out a be from each of these terms in the salvation.  And so what we get it and can be written as b x a bunch of expansion plus the coefficient in the ones place.  What that does for us is lettuce do long division the way that we may have done in grade school or if we have a special-purpose piece of Hardware. That's just responsible for long division. We can do that really quickly.  And doing that long division spits out a 0 as the remainder of that long division.  And then tells us in terms of the quotient with the remaining amount of value that we need to represent.  So this is kind of abstract Let's do an actual example where we Trace through the algorithm to what I'd like to do is Trace through using algorithm to the calculation of the base 3 expansion.  17  So in this algorithm if we're thinking of tracing it the variables that we have RN and be as part of the input and when were asking for the base 3 expansion of 17 that's like calling this function base 2 on input 17 and 3 or 17 is the number we're trying to represent and 3 is the base.  And so in our Trace table and has a value of 17 to start a B has the value 3 + in lines 2 and 3 were declaring these variables q and K and Q get the value 17 + K gets the value of 0.  Set this point our table is just reflecting the initial values of these variables as we've gone through lines 1 2 and 3 of the pseudocode.  So now we enter this while loop and we can think of Q as serving this role of the amount of the number that we still have to figure out a representation for and so while she was nonzero while we still have some work to do to represent the rest of the number we're going to be able to compute a sub K and so at the beginning a septet is a Sub-Zero because K started off as zero and we calculate that using Q modbee.  So to calculate Q modbee means to calculate the remainder upon division by be of q17bus 3, so we need the remainder upon division by 3 of 17. So we need to write 17 as the quotient of x 3 plus the remainder.  and  when we think of how to express 17 as an integer times 3 plus a remainder then we can write it as 5 * 3 + 2 * 17 is 5 * 3 + 2 so that means that the remainder here is Q mod 3 and that's two.  And cue get updated with the value of Q Disney sets the quotient upon into integer division of 17 x 3. That's the multiple of 5 of 3 this fits inside 17 and then K gets updated to the volume one.  Penske was still nonzero we go back into this while loop body and now in line 5. We're calculating a sub one because K has been updated to 1.  I want to calculate a sub one. We need to do the long division of the current value of Q by the base and the current value of Q is 5 so we're expressing 5S something * 3 + a remainder and 3/5 once into 5 with a remainder 2. And so that means that V mod 3 is too and that's what gets stored in a sablan.  Buck you get updated as the quotient here. So that's one and we increment k  Alright, are we done?  No, because Q right now is one and the while loop conditions in line for is the Q is non-zero. She was still nonzero. We do the loop body one more time at least and so that means they were updated now the coefficient a sub to his K is too so we have to do the long division as we divide 1 by 3. So we need to represent one as some integer times 3 plus a remainder. How can we write 1 as some integer times 3 plus a remainder is 0 * 3 + 2 remainder one, which means that the coefficient here is the remainder one the Q gets updated to zero K get updated to three and so the result that we return here is the coefficients in the opposite order from what we calculated 122 in base 3.  I know because now we can tell that we should check our work. That's what I love about these basic that she was very comforting cuz you can always check your work and we could calculate what's 2 + 2 * 922 + 2 * 3 + 9 + we get 17.  already, so  what will do on Monday is this other representations? Make sure that you're on track with everything you need and let us know if you have class.  UC San Diego podcast. EDU "
