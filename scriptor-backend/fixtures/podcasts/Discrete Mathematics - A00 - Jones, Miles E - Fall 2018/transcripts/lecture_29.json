    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  and yeah, well  go back to my  I guess I never saved it.  All right.  alright, so  let's get started last class. We're just going to continue along with the review. Don't forget your capes their due Monday.  So we'll just start off from where we left off. You guys. Remember the clicker question that we had the last quicker question.  Well, I added a new one because wait a minute.  Let me just get the clicker thing going.  I want you guys to be.  To understand what the different symbols mean.  Okay, which one of these statements is true?  Take your time.  Okay.  Hey, there still is a bit of confusion here.  Anybody have any questions or comments?  Are we all happy with one only?  Okay, so I personally took.  But you understand why now?  Why is the second painting AC I guess for this particular example for B?  Why is this one not correct?  Yeah, also look at the definition of subset. This will be a good way to test right this is saying every element of your first set has to also be an element of your second set to a particular.  Hey is in a c but a is not OA is in there.  C is in a c but she is not in the second set is in.  A c c is not in.  a b  AC  I any questions about that.  Okay.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, you didn't even see what I wrote their. Sorry.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  stop.  Yeah, what about it?  of this  You want the power set of this thing?  Okay. Well you get the empty set right and you get the set containing the set containing a  Right. It's a it's a it's a set with only one element. So it's power set only has two elements.  Renee II painting a this one. This one's wrong to right because he is in the first set but a is not in the second sin know it's confusing.  Is it also include which one?  Yeah, it's contained all the subsets of that set that these are the only subsets.  No, the second inning a is an element of the set. It's not a subset of a set.  I know it's confusing.  So this is what we have here. We have the second painting a is an element of the set.  It's not a subset.  Yeah, the power set includes all subsets.  Yeah, this is the power set here.  Should I also include this?  It's Al.  Yeah, that's all there is.  What's that doesn't have any subsets?  This site here.  That has two subsets the empty set and itself.  I know it's confusing.  notation  Okay, that was just a warm-up question for this question.  Okay now.  power set  which of the following is that not true in general has an element of the power set of s empty set is an element of the power set of s s is a subset of the power set of empty set is a subset of the power set of ass.  Anybody have any comments or questions?  Are we happy with c?  No.  It looks like that's what the majority of students are saying now. It's not the majority anymore, but it's a very large minority.  We happy with that anybody have any comments.  Like that is an elephant and they're not contradictory.  Pest Control, El Paso  Play say what you just said again includes as in it there for S is a element right? So that's kind of.  You see what the difference there?  I know it's been I know it's confusing. I'm sorry. I didn't make up this notation.  Okay, don't blame the messenger.  I mean I do so I will say I do like this notation, but I didn't make it.  Okay. So what you just said that proves This One S is always going to be an element of a snow matter what it's always the case.  Okay, the empty set is also always going to be an element of the power set of asked why because the empty set is a subset of every set.  Okay this one.  Not always true. It could be true in certain examples, but not always true.  How about this one here?  the empty set is a subset of  every set  an example of what?  Okay. Yeah, so I'll give you two examples.  Let is s is equal to the set 1/2 right then the power set of ass is empty set set containing one set containing to set containing 1/2.  So in this case as is not a subset of the power set of us.  Okay, what if s were?  Hey, this is kind of weird, but it's one.  Wait, how did I add a we do it?  1  let's just let's just make it easy.  I think so.  No, yes.  Yes, I think it's the only case.  Does I think that might be the only case?  Why say it again?  Let's call this S1. Like maybe this is S Prime.  the empty sac  it's the set containing the empty set.  That's it.  That's it. That's all you get.  You just get that.  exactly  anything else  should I move on?  Seems like a good like type of problem to put on me final exam, huh?  some set stuff  How about some examples here give an example of a well-defined one-to-one function from the set a to its power set? Okay, let's say is the set 1 2 3 answer. This is just want you guys to think about how would you design a one-to-one function?  Any ideas for this one?  I can't wait till you're mapping F of n  no, this is our set here.  What is it?  Ashley Antoinette  equals and but what about in  Set containing in.  This is well-defined because all the sets containing just one element of an right of the set there in its in the power set and it's one to one because if you have two different numbers than their their values after the function will be two different results.  Hey, if you like you can you can just kind of do it explicitly of 1 is 1/2 of 2 is 2.  half of 3 is 3  is that the only one to one function?  Now you can make another one, right?  Okay, how about an onto function?  impossible, right  We showed that already that the power set always has strictly more elements than the original sin. Okay. How about a function? That is neither one to one nor onto?  I guess whatever nooran to you can't even make it onto on stuff. What's a function? That's not one to one?  Okay, good. It's going to be a half of n is equal to.  The second inning one or something like that like a constant function.  Good questions.  Okay, when you said that you have to find a function from a table.  No.  It just needs to be that the image of the function like the result of the function. It always has to be in the power set. That's what it means.  Okay.  How about some induction practice?  Let's do some structural induction first for any bit string zero Zero's of w is less than or equal to a love W. What is Zero's of w a l explain it to you or I'll give you a recursive definition. It turns out that it's going to be the number of zeros in the bitstream queso.  Zero's of the empty string is 0 right. The empty string has no zeros in it.  Zero's of 0w is equal to 1 + 0 w.  However, many zeros were in that word. Plus that one in the beginning.  Zero's 1w is equal to 0 w.  So this is a way to define this function structure recursively. Okay. How about a low do you guys remember what that one was L of the string is?  0 L of 0w is 1 + LW.  a loved one W is 1 + lfw  I'm so you could see the car the difference now. Let's do a structural induction to show that.  Something that's very obvious. The number of zeros of a word is going to be less than or equal to the length of the word.  Okay, so basic step.  zeros  Lambda  is equal to length of Lambda, which is 0  So just prove that it's true on all the bass cases. There's only one base case, so  inductive step  suppose  for some string  W that here's the  here's the statement zeros of w.  Is less than or equal to length of WW2 assume that for one of these strings. This is true. Now we need to do is show that the result is true under every single rule is only two rules. So we just have to do two results.  Okay, so  zeros  0w  is equal to 1 +  zeros  W right  Which is less than or equal to buy the inductive hypothesis  Then one plus length of w, right and that turns out to be equal to length of 0 W Okay. So we've shown that the result of adding a zero you still have this property.  There are the result of adding a wine you still have this property possible.  Zero's 1w is equal to 1 + 0.  Which is less than or equal to  like a w right if we if we're using the inductive hypothesis directly, but length of w is less than or equal to 1 + length of w.  Which is equal to length of 1 w.  So remember the steps for structural induction show that it works for the basis step and then assume that it works for a for a certain word.  And then show that it works for every rule that you have on that word.  Okay, so we had to do two cuz there's two rules.  Turn off my location.  No, wait.  when I write zeros  Yeah, that's the number of zeros are in w.  Yeah, you're kind of concatenate in a zero onto the string.  Any other questions?  Lmw wrestler equal to less than either way's fine.  If something is less than something else than it it's also less than or equal to that.  This is like just my way of thinking about it. I guess is that this year?  Is the inductive hypothesis, so I wanted to like apply the inductive hypothesis directly to so that you can see that step and then after that you can kind of do the rest.  Okay, let's do another induction example. This one's going to be strong induction.  This is kind of like a interesting piece of history. Is that in? Ancient Egypt? They didn't use like fractions like we do here like hear when we you say a fraction. You have some number divided by another number in ancient Egypt. They only like to use unit fractions which are like fractions with a 1 in the numerator.  And so every fraction that we can make they could expand into a sum of unit fractions.  I don't know why this helped but they use that to build the pyramids. So it must have been something important. So for example, if I said 2 / 5  Is there a way that I can write this in terms of it as a sum of unit fractions this turns out to be equal to 1/3 + 1/15.  Oh, sorry. Yeah, the  write the other thing is that they wanted all of the fractions to be different.  What are all the numbers to be different? I guess I didn't say that.  Why I don't know it's built the pyramids though. So, I mean we have to respect it.  Is this always possible to do?  We're about to see.  how about  how about 13 / 15?  Well, I have my notes here. So we're not I don't expect you guys to know how to do this. I'm actually going to give you an algorithm to do it, but this actually has two answers. You could do 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/6 or 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/30.  pretty crazy  Okay. So this is the claim is that any rational number can be written this way with distinct integers D1 food EK.  Okay. Now the first thing I'm going to do is show you an algorithm to do this. And then the second thing I'm going to do is show you that the algorithm is correct using strong induction. This is kind of a weird induction problem. I will say because we're not cut we're not really showing something is true for an equals 1 2 3 right we're showing something is true for fractions. So you're going to see kind of how I  like force that into our induction form  Okay, here's the algorithm. It turns out it's a greedy algorithm, which means you basically make the best choice you can and then you you change the problem you reduce the problem and then you make the next best choice and so on. What do I mean by Best Choice? It's basically  you you start out with your fraction and you find the biggest.  Unit fraction that's less than it.  I think that may be doing an example.  What kind of help our understanding of the algorithm?  Okay, so let's do this example 13 / 15.  Okay, so this is going to be my C value.  That's what you start with.  Okay, what's the largest fraction? What's the largest unit fraction that is less than  see  1 / 2  okay good. So well see is greater than zero cases C is greater than zero find the largest unit fraction Okay, so  I guess our first iteration.  We have one over n is 1/2. Okay, so we output 1/2 into our list. That's one of the fractions and then C becomes.  13 / 15 - 1/2 anybody know what that is.  Who's got a calculator?  What is it?  1110 / 30  11 / 38 good  Okay, now what's the biggest fraction what's the biggest unit fraction that is less than 11/30  1/3 right  so we get C is equal to 11 teen / 30 - 1/3. What is that one over 30? Okay, then once you get a unit fraction itself, that will be the next one write 1 / n is equal to 1/30 and then you get C is equal to 1/30 - 1/30 which is 0 okay, and that that's when the algorithm terminates and your output list is just these one over and numbers you get.  Pretty cool, right?  Okay, does this is it always going to work or did I just pick a very specific?  fractions  you can work.  We're going to prove that it works.  Okay.  Let's prove that it works. Okay, the way we're going to do this is prove it to be true for every for every fraction that has a numerator from one right from that's equal to 1 2 3 4 up to end. Okay, so we're kind of inducting on the numerator itself.  So here's the clean.  p over Q can be  Let's call it decompose, I guess.  into a sum of distinct  unit  fractions  for all  all  key equal to 1 2 3  and any Q greater than  0  I guess I should say.  Such that.  p over Q is in between 0 and 1  Inclusive. Okay, so I know this is kind of like a big claim here, but let's just see how it works with the induction.  Okay basis step.  P is equal to 1 what's the only fraction?  That we have to look at but not the only one but any fraction of this form is really simple. It's already a unit fraction. So the basis step is that if you have a unit fraction that it's just a sum of 1 unit fraction bases that P is equal to 1 so 1 / Q is equal to 1 / Q for all Q.  I know it's kind of like.  Trivial, but you kind of see the thing question.  Yeah, the original number you start with P over Q some fraction it some integer on top of another integer.  Yeah.  Yeah, you want it you want it to decompose into a sum of distinct unit fractions?  I just want to say it in the claim. You don't have to say it again.  Frank I mean p over Q is a  a fraction and so that implies that Q is not 0 right. I just wanted to kind of  reiterate that  okay, let's go. Let's ride our strong inductive hypothesis.  Okay, so  4  okay, let  let K be some.  integer  greater  then one greater than one.  What's a greater than or equal to one?  Okay, we can just say greater than zero. That's fine.  Play me some E-40.  Ain't no let's do one.  Okay, K is strictly greater than one now assume.  that  4  every fraction  p over Q with  she in between one.  and K  that P over Q can be decomposed.  decomposed in the thing  Okay. So this is the strong induction hypothesis. Remember it's kind of like the P of one and using p again, but remember P of one and you're saying it's true for like this whole bunch of problems. We're going to use that to prove that it's true for p. Okay. Okay, so we want to show  want  I want to show that.  any fraction  k / Q can be decomposed.  Okay.  Thanks for now. We'll do the proof.  This is all set up.  Do the proof now?  All right.  Okay, so what's the first thing you do so given cat UK start with?  some k / Q  What's the first thing in the algorithm that you do?  You find what?  Write the greatest fraction that's less than it. Okay, so  find  and such that  1 / n is less than k / Q.  And Cara Q is less than 1 / N - 1 why did I put that? How can I know that it's less than 1 / N - 1  How do I know it's in that range?  was that  Yeah, whatever. It's the biggest one, right so whenever and -1 have to be to Big exactly.  All right. I'm going to probably I'm going to just make myself a little bit more room here.  Family just rewrite that so start with k over Q. Right I find.  and such that and is less one of her and is less than k / Q is less than 1 / N - 1  now I just bear with me here. We're just going to do a little bit of calculation here.  Given this you guys know how to do like the cross multiply thing. Okay. So what does that give us? That means that k x + -1 is less than Q.  K n minus K is less than Q.  And this actually means that we'll come back to that in a minute. We're going to need that later. Okay now  You set Ruben the algorithm. You set C to be equal to C - 1 / n. Okay. So in this case, we set C to be equal to k / Q - 1 / and how do you do this? Well, this is going to be kn- Q / q n  Using the common denominator now. Let me just rewrite this thing as K and mine is Q is less than k  now we have this text so that comes from that we know that's true. Okay. So this is the big part of the induction. This is where we get our induction hypothesis. We know that kn- Q is less than K. Therefore this fraction has a numerator less than K. What do we know about fractions with numerator is less than k  We can decompose them. That's the inductive hypothesis. So since this fractured this new fraction, we have has a numerator less than K. It could be decomposed.  Okay, and that's basically at okay, so since  K + - Q is less than k k n - Q / q n can be decomposed.  Into 1. / let's say 1 / d 1 + 1 / d 2 + all the way up to + 1 / lesedi. I don't know m.  Frank and what is cayenne - 2 / Q in it's just c - 1 / n so we just add one over end to this.  this sequence  Okay, / Q can be decomposed.  21 / n + 1 / d 1 + 1 / 52 + all the way up to plus 1 over DM  questions  Green Bay Packers next game for free Samsung  Yeah.  That's hard question. You just I guess that's all I mean, it's hard question to answer because all the problems are so different the one where you were making change.  For that one.  You could kind of predict what was going to happen in the sense that in order to solve a certain problem. You needed to lie to look back in time exactly three places right every time so if it's always going to be a fixed number of  Positions that you have to look back like 3-4 that example then it's most likely that you're going to have to do three base base cases to kind of like pad it up so that once you get there, they can start this one on the other hand. It's unpredictable how how much smaller kn- Q is from K. Right? All we base it on is that it's less than so. We don't have to like worry about if it's  You know the real ass or 4 Less or something like that. So if it's unpredictable, then you can't really go with a fixed number of bass cases. I don't know if that helps.  There is a way to do it but the the strong induction way, I don't think you can get around the three base cases.  Yeah, I said that K. I said that.  said that P over Q has to be in between 0 and 1 so that implies that  okay.  This one more little thing that I sort of left out that maybe you can think about why this is the case. Remember that the Egyptians wanted all of those unit fractions to be different. How can I be so sure?  That n is different than all of these things here.  It's kind of a  question for you guys, or do you have an answer?  Yeah, it's kind of like it one over and is going to be too big now. Right? Cuz we chose it to be the biggest one and then we subtracted It Off.  and so  You do whatever you do, whatever you have resulting will have to be smaller than one over in.  smile Brands Destiny 2  exactly  Okay, let's move on.  Oh, I'm out. I'm already out of time.  Oh well.  Didn't realize I was going to take the whole time.  All right. Well, we have a review section review session. Where's that review session is on Sunday from 12 to 1:50 and Warren lecture hall 2005. It will be broadcasted. It's going to basically go over the practice problems and then we'll give you the solutions to the practice problems.  Okay, so see you guys on Tuesday.  Thanks. Thank you for being a good class.  I hope you guys had a little bit of fun. I know that this class could be like really annoying and frustrating but I hope that there were times where you had a little bit of joy and learn something.
