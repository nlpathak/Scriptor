    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Alright, let's get started.  so  so I'm normally do the other lecture but miles is out of town today. So you got me for today and will be continuing with some little quieter, please.  Will be continuing with some uses of modular arithmetic and then I'll also be going over a few of the last homework problems just to get some extra examples of some of those things.  So the start with what we talkin about the euclidean algorithm, which is used for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers. So your goal is to find the largest number which is a multiple of G and B is also a multiple of  I just make sure we're all on the same page with what we're talking about 6, okay quick clicker question. What is the gcd of 50 and 70? What is that greatest common divisor?  Click it if you haven't yet.  Hi, there was General agreement on this one that it was see which is correct. So right and that's because all of these are in fact divisors.  of  A&B 25 is not a divisor of both A and B. It's a divisor of 15 out of 70 and then other things are divisors 10 is the biggest of them.  So in some some reasons that we might want to find greatest common divisor is include if we're reducing fractions or often times in cryptography. It's useful to have relatively prime pairs of numbers numbers that don't share any factors until it's important to check that the gcd is equal to 1  So here is our algorithm for finding greatest common divisors. And so the wavelets is run through this with an example. We just had a and b were 50 and 70 from the previous slide.  And so will create this list of decreasing numbers will start with A and B will make sure to put them in decreasing order. So c0 is 70 c 158. That's the maximum and minimum respectively.  and then we're going to repeatedly take laws so see to  is equal to C 0 mod C1.  which is  70 Mach 50, which is 20  And then C3 real similar to take them all out of the previous two.  so that's going to be  50 + 20 what is equal to 10 and then finally see for will take them out of the previous to 2010 and that's equal to zero.  And so he's repeatedly take mods with the decreasing sequence of numbers and eventually went 0 and whatever you got right before 0-1 term in the sequence right before we zero is going to be the actual greatest common divisor to this case. That's 10.  Questions on the definition of this this algorithm explained through it.  I'll go through Wyatt works in the moment.  All right. So the claim is that  Masago them always works. It'll always get us the greatest common divisor of any two numbers.  So the proof of that is proof is going to be in two parts. We want to show that the result is in fact a divisor of A&B. What's the greatest divisor?  Dino's to pieces  so  It's our first I first sub clean is going to be that it is a divisor of A&D.  so  so a is a multiple of 7 - 1.  and  he is a multiple of c are in -1.  And we're going to do this using strong induction to prove something is true about all the elements of this sequence.  So  so we're actually improve is somewhat. It's a somewhat stronger statement showing that it has multiple poops.  So we're going to show.  run the show that every single every single item in that sequence is a multiple of c and -1  and if we can do that, well, then c0 is one of a or b and c one of the other one and so we will have successfully shown that A and B are each multiples of seeing - 1  Professional questions why this is all we need to show for this part.  Let's go ahead and show that then.  so  a strong induction  Tab 8 cases  I'll show that.  Russia going to do this in reverse order.  We want to show CNN and see at -1.  are multiples of  CM -1  alright, so  CN equals what * 10 - 1  what is what is the value of CN at the end of this algorithm always?  02 CNN is in fact a multiple of 2 and -1 x 0 x - 1  and  and then see a minus one is definitely a multiple of itself.  I forgot that we got to be at the very end of the list are definitely multiples of c and -1.  So now let's do the inductive step for this.  so  stop  we're going to  throw in a 6K  and assumed they were doing strong induction here.  Totally not a whole bunch of it's true for whole bunch of these elements all at once.  assume that  CSN - k  + - k + 1  all the way up to  then  are all  multiples of 7 minus 1  And now we want to show.  that Co + - k + 1  it's also a multiple.  so  How is how are these? How is Asia of relating to our other we have see if 10 - 2 + 1 +?  How is it related to the other CN values?  So we keep on using this rule to compute new elements of the sequence.  so what we have is  sea of hand- k + 1 -  is equal to  CFN -8 + 1  Lord Sear in minus k  that we take we always take the element to to two spaces earlier mod by the one one space earlier to get like the current one.  Here we have here. We have that two spaces earlier ones place earlier and the current.  so that's going to that equation is going to be true just because of the way the algorithm runs that's just directed reading it out of the algorithm and then  we can apply the inductive hypothesis. So  this one is still unknown. That's the thing. We're trying to prove something about.  But the others are all within our inductive hypothesis.  So we know.  We know that Steven when is K?  is a multiple of 7 - 1 write this as a  CMS one  I know right? This one is  d c and -1. Is that also?  That's also a hypothesis.  And so we can then using the definition of mod.  I have that.  See you then minus K plus one.  equal to  song multiple  of  see you in a minute, okay?  Plus the remainder.  armendariz  B  10 - 1  the finely that is been just  Seaway plus p  So I knew Ella a new item in the list is in fact, some integer times are greatest common divisor thing at the end. The whole thing or trying to prove is the greatest common divisor.  questions on this so far  All right, so that's that's one of the two things we needed. So.  successfully showed that it is sung divisor at IND  Now what makes it the greatest divisor de Indie. Maybe it's just another device. ER maybe it's one or many divisors of A&D perhaps. So why do we know that this value is is the greatest common divisor.  so  I'll be the other stop playing.  and that's going to be  Southview  Also better than greater than or equal to.  d  greatest common divisor  it is a divisor and is also at least as big as the greatest common divisor, then it must be the greatest common divisor.  So so I can prove this something right here, then we're done.  questions on that  so let's go ahead and prove this one and again when approved by induction using a stronger claim which is  What size of show that?  every  t i is a  multiple of  tcda be in order to stop writing GTA V all the time. I'm going to rename that thing G. So every CI is a multiple of it and if ever. - 1  Well if it's nonzero, and so if it's a multiple of G the smallest I could possibly be isn't she so it's at least as big as G.  personal app  so let's go ahead and prove this one.  And again, it's going to be strong induction.  So these cases that cheetahs survive c0?  And she has to divide he won this is what we want to show.  So how do we show it was our algorithm again up in the corner?  How do we know that c0 and C1 are both multiples of G?  She is the greatest common divisor of AMD.  What are the values of c 0 in C one in some order?  I heard someone.  Se71 are Just A and B. I don't know which is which but see one one of them is the bigger the two ones the smaller of the two. So 21 are just a and b  and by definition A and B are multiples of any divisor of AMD as I mean for something to be a divisor the greatest common divisor or any other divisor divisor. Is that is that so  C0 and C1 are A and B.  AR  multiples of G  by definition of g  Carson. Net  ice now what to do  inductive step  so  we're going to  I guess I should write fix.  XK  and assume  bad  c0 C1 through c k  are all multiples.  LG  First time wax during induction and sort of the more normal directions starting from zero going upward.  since now  we want to show that cfk + 1.  He is also a multiple of G.  I'm approved for this is going to look very similar to the previous one since we know that.  See if k + 1 is equal to.  see if King - 1 mod apk  and so so we can write that down as  CK minutes Juan equals sum multiple of this Plus  the remainder  and then we'll just rearrange this towards the thing we actually care about.  CK + 1 equals  she came in a swan.  -2  CK and then finally by the inductive hypothesis, we can replace each of those other Seas by some constant * G.  This is biting. Cuz I thought that this is a g - Q PNG.  As it once again. We having multiple G.  I said at the end of this proof.  So just some further examples using induction and modular arithmetic there any questions on it?  I thought you wanted something a bit different.  So rindu zero-knowledge proof on this is the kind of another sort of cryptography type concept used in protocols say on the internet if you are some user and say you want to like convince a website are you that you have some password without actually sending the password or something like that?  So I really I really like the word proof is a little bit misleading in in $0 proofs on because the  Maybe you weren't convinced. This is  this is really more of a probabilistic statement.  You want to convince up to some threshold of probability? Maybe maybe that's 99% maybe 99.9, but I'm like a real proof. It doesn't actually convince someone 100% but he'll be close enough.  So I have here a example of what I'm talking about. It's a non math examples first, cuz I think it's a bit simpler than me math when I have coming up next is I'll be playing the role of Bob here. I have two markers that one red one blue. So maybe I can buy denticle. How would you play the role Dallas convinced me that these two are actually different that you can tell them apart. So what are referring you going to access to other people University Electronics? You just have to do some kind of interaction with me that will convince me. You can tell Noah part. When are you first talk with your neighbors for a minute see what you can come up with and then I'll take some suggestions.  so  How's it going over here?  So does anyone want to share what they came up with?  How do I restart this?  How do you  exactly  So for those who can hear it was we're going to label the two markers. So here I've done that little blue Post-it notes on them. And then so I sit out for now. I can't tell which is which and now I can repeatedly shuffle them and I say are you think you can tell the difference by which one is this one? You can answer supplement again and tell which one this one you still say blue-eyed so clearly you can tell the difference if you're every time I'm able to tell which is which so how many times should I do this before I get convinced do you think  That's a pretty arbitrary question. I mean, it's it's really up to me. I was skeptical I want to be right but each time I do it. I'm reducing the Chance by half and you could be tricking me because you in fact I actually can't tell the difference between the two if they are in fact identical like I think they are then then every time I do this challenge, I think this you have a half chance of being wrong until either and so are you with enough time had a chance of being wrong to be right than 1/4 chance and 1/8 chance. So by the time I've done this a lot of times I can get as convinced as I want to be never 100% but I can be very convinced that you can in fact tell the difference which is which  11 need property was kind of proves the first of all the new zero knowledge part to go back to the other definitions. So at the end of this at the end of this process, I'm convinced that you can tell the difference. However, other than that I should have learned nothing new in particular. I still can't tell the difference without my labels and not only that I can't even convince someone else that you can tell the difference if I showed a video tape. I got you. I taped the whole process and I said look at that every time I pull this out every time they were able to tell what you was skeptical just I will know you disagree in advance which one you bought each time doesn't prove anything. So  Sodexo like really the $0. I haven't learned anything. Other than that, you can tell the difference also not the kind that you can actually do as a protocol on the internet. However, now I have a version of this that you could do over the Internet so I can bring their own modular arithmetic back in so  Alice has three numbers that Raji p and X that she chose. However, she wanted to pretty much needs to be a prime.  So I was teasing some numbers and confused you the X mod P.  And then shares most of the numbers publicly gpny.  Now as we discussed briefly at the end of last class its survey. It's just kind of an assumption in cryptography that there is no no feasible way of computer, even when you know why G&P that is still just takes way too long to compute X, we're not we don't have a proof of this but no one has yet found a fast algorithm for computing X as long as he's numbers are really big obviously chose and a one-digit numbers here. You can just brute force it and figure out what exit is but if these are all instead like 300 digit numbers modern computers just can't answer this and we don't have any clever solution. So even after revealing GP and why is still a secret from everyone other than Ellis, who knows?  so now  Alice is the only person in the world in those acts in so she can prove her identity by revealing if she wants a end and then it's easy. It's once you have exit easy to check that. It's the correct number. What's the problem with this plan?  What's the problem with verification skating needs to prove her identity. She just shows x two people.  Why does it not work?  Write this is a scheme that work. Once right one time. I was with a look on the real Alice he was X but but after that it stops working kind of horribly does X2 and also prove that Bob is so  so take two.  We're going to have to do this sort of zero-knowledge proof thing. You have to prove that, you know X without actually reviewing it in the same way as you like, if you prove that you know, which marker is which without actually explaining how you're figuring it out. Actually making you no longer colorblind, so  So the way we're going to do that is similar modular arithmetic.  So each round of this interaction in the same way as they were rounds in the marker thing right around 1 marker and you would answer something and I'll get a new round and pull out a new marker. So here  Each round Alice is going to choose our new random number are and compute this GTR HP and reveal see reveal what the value of all PS. Am. I the same argument as before to Bob now knows see cuz it was just revealed in GNP because those were shared earlier. We're still interesting that are can't be computed in a reasonable amount of time by Bob. The Bob still doesn't know our  And now Bob has so he's just a summary. Again. Alice now has two secret Sexton. And then there's gpy and see that are all public.  And now bought us two choices dog can either ask for our directly and Alice will give it to him or Bob can ask for the value of this weird thing.  Call Lindsay and Alice.  so  and then Bob can check that that what he's been told so far makes sense. So if in fact asks for and gets are  Then now Bob has CGR and pee and so once you have all the numbers, it's easy to check that the equation holes. And so that everything else did so far was on the up-and-up and did in fact have those numbers.  And if instead of us through this number Z.  Then we'll be verifying this other equation. Let's go through this briefly why it works so  So we have see why.  mod P equal to  the definition of c was g2br  Monte  And the definition of why was PDX?  Monte  So this entire thing?  Are you taking mud p?  I know.  What rule of modular arithmetic can I use to simplify this a little bit?  Are doing multiplication all nodding by the same thing. So we had a rule from a previous class that a d is equal to.  Baymont Inn  Dino Dan  well, then I forgot to take this one to live in reverse.  And get rid of these extra monkeys.  so  I'm getting cheated ERG to the x.  Monte otherwise known as to the x + r  my pee doing part of this prove. I will not be able to prove to you for this is just a theory.  What is we can put in a multi minus one up there?  so  this  better quality is due to if you want to do you want to look up why that's legit.  Yeah, something called 4 mods little theorem.  So and then finally that is just  cheetah the Z  bumpy  So so that's that's why these two quantities Cy Montee and Montee should be equal and Bob has enough of those numbers to check that they are actually equal.  so  so no matter what I got her which one thought I'd ask for even as a check he can perform to make sure that the numbers have been told so far makes sense. However, the number that isn't old isn't actually useful by itself to use to check that things make sense, but it is itself just a random number if you ask for R&R was chosen at random. I was a definition for our if you have for this thing, this thing is also actually completely random because we just we had me start with something that isn't Random Acts a completely random number are the result becomes completely random.  And so the all Alice is actually told Bobby they completely random number so doesn't know anything new about what exit is but I got us some information to start checking that things are working out and the part I won't be proving here is that if Alice does not actually no accent is trying to cheat here on Alice can prepare for either one of these two queries, but not both so to bother as a half chance either asking for or Z that have chance we choose the right one that I was won't have an answer that will check out.  Homicide just like the marker case each time. You do it one round of this. You can become more and more convinced that Alice. It doesn't fact know everything she claims to know.  Any questions on this?  All right. So in the remaining time in today's class, I just wanted to go over whatever you all thought was hardest in the previous homework, so  Yeah, then we will be posting solution soon as well. But I think you're doing it interactively can help so you can get your questions answered at the solutions don't make sense to you. So here are the four questions for the previous homework. The first one it was structural induction.  The second one was all of those figuring out whether things were finite countably infinite or uncountable.  The third one was the one with a binary relation.  And the fourth one was the modular arithmetic. So why don't you vote with your clickers which one you'd like to see? So ABCD Lee one-two-three-four and we can start discussing that one.  specific question  I know you're going for a b c d 1 2 3 4.  All right, you can sense the well is a slight slight majority for two with the second most common D3 do some of each of those So within two maybe just vote again. So now it's actually the letters here. I guess you can't go for a stupid enough buttons, but you can vote for a b c d r e I will do that one.  American want to make sure he gets you at least three.  so  All right, it's pretty even I guess I guess what we doing most of most of them maybe so I won't be writing out formal proof. Some nice lives. You can wait for the day when was supposed to Solutions later today or maybe tomorrow you can see each other and how we prove it. So starting with a sew a it's got this codomain are you might be able to guess that it's probably uncountable because there but that's not enough by itself to prove it and and this one's actually so so huge you don't even know where to begin off and write like this. The number of functions is a whole lot of functions are symmetric for this one is choosing a manageable subset of of your set, which you can still prove is uncountable so far original set.  is s  then we're taking new set.  so maybe I'll just to find out who said it's only okay for no good reason but k b  set of  functions  that map  all integers to the same real  support example if I have the function f of x equals pi  F will be in K because mapping every single integer to just one real pie and it has some other function like say f of x equals X plus one or something letter G then G is not in K because getting naps to just one real.  So now I have this subset queso questions on how to find Inkay.  So so this is a subset of all the functions and yet and now this subset it should be a lot easier to show why this one is uncountable because I can set up my bijection as follows. I got a function f of x equals pi and I will put that in correspondence with the real known as pie and I have another function f of x equals 0.1 and I'll put the correspondence with the real known as 0.1 and so on.  That's why every one of these functions is getting map to exactly one real and vice versa.  Hi, this is an invertible. This is a bijection between these functions and the reals you can take a function to get a real we could also take a real and get a function right I start with a real start with route to I can work backwards and figure out what the function is it the function f of x equals root tip.  Should I put my Jackson so so what this what this proves then is that the size of K is equal to the size of our  so  I and then well s is at least as big as k  right because because Kelly was chosen to be a subset of us.  And so I mean that ice is at least as big as our which means is uncountable.  The challenge with this one is just like he was so uncountable is he never talked about so make it more manageable find find some subset of what you can work with any questions on that.  All right, so maybe what's to idle p2b is kind of a trick question. We know like we know as a fact.  Z  is strictly smaller than the real.  know if  So I guess I just like I'll keep on calling things a suppose. So if s is nonempty, that means there exists a one-to-one function with domain R and codomain z  Then we would have that the reals.  Alyssa Nicole busy. This is this is Paul and there are not at the wheels are strictly bigger than Z.  And so and so therefore it's the contradiction so s is in fact the empty set. So for be there be there are no one to one functions from R&B and soul.  questions on that  Yes.  Intensive is finite.  Because because the set in question, I just said SVU is the empty set and the empty set is finite.  I so so it's it is it sort of a trick question because it sounds like I'm asking about some large set of things the set of all functions matching certain criteria, but they're actually no function.  So yeah, so it's the only one on here that the rest were all figuring out which an infant it is.  Think I'll do one more of these and I will do some of 3 to make sure we have time for that. So let's do  what time is it at all possible to Dallas-Fort programs?  JavaScript  so so often times when we're proving that something is countably infinite. Wish this one is a lot to be done in two parts. So  So it's on his so-called again. I'll just keep calling an ass.  so  so if Prime. Clean is going to be that he's in fact infinit.  and then  later on.  I will also prove that.  That ass is countable.  And then those two claims together.  enough to show that f is equal to  The boss and so it's countably infinite infinite proofs. Usually this first part showing that it is infinite at all is usually not too difficult. So, for example, we can have a  let  Fon equal  the program  that  Prince  high end times  I was definitely a program that prints high once is definitely a separate program that will print out the word height twice and so on so there are infinitely many programs.  So this is  f is  one to one  from  z+ to us  questions on that  So again again, this is your kind of like the previous case it often helps to look at a subset or superset that's easy to count by 2 all programs kind of hard account, but the sub data program, they're just doing something very specific either one time or two times or three times that's easy to see that it's infinite cuz we can do it. One two, three four different numbers. They're all different programs.  So that that one?  And then to show that it's a show that it is.  The show that it is countably infinite again. I don't really want to deal with a superset. So every s is a strict subset of K.  Where kid is the set of all strings with valid symbols, and maybe we'll have numbers in there and we'll have letters in there and we'll have some other symbols in there, but there are under the stars.  So there are finite number of different symbols that are allowed in a JavaScript program. There are a lot of them you can have letters you can have numbers you can have symbols like less than but it is a finite set of symbols.  And so and so he said that now okay. We're no longer going to worry about child's your program's now. We're just to think about all the strings using the set of symbols.  I want you to know that now I'll just say it the same as for bit strings for bit strings. We found a way to list. List out all the short ones and put them in the order in some way. And then we want a longer and longer ones. You can do that with Vista two strings to start with all the ones symbol strings like 0 and 1 and less than write. The program is superset that is all the strings then move on to the slightly longer strings a tattoo symbols list them all out and so on so we can list it out. It's kind of infinite.  questions on that  Yes.  Yeah, so interesting way.  I'm right so you can compute you can write individual. Associate programs that compute functions from domain see Dakota main are however this what is proof actually show is basically is that there are some functions. He will not be able to write in JavaScript ever.  I definitely definitely some that you can write you can write it down with your function that doubles things that you can write up. What's your function that everything the pie but necessarily there must be some functions. You just can't write because there are uncountable many functions and unaccountably many programs.  other questions on this  Yeah, so you can't actually write all of those that you can definitely write the program that I can buy the individual program that multiplies 1 by pie or the individual program to have you talked about.  Yes, actually not all those are actually representable because how do you like so how do you write the real itself in the program I so I can right now in JavaScript if you like VAR x equals 0.1 I can write that right? I can even write instead of 0.1. I can write something like, you know, not that high or something right? So you definitely write some of these in JavaScript but there are but there is this real for which for what there's nothing I can right there like some real just have an infinite decimal thing and don't have any nice description. And so I said I won't exist the way to write it in Dallas-Fort even though the real incest.  I cannot off the top of my head. I'll try to find it to you later. Sorry.  All right.  so  videos to do a quick part of three the most out of time. So let's do as a proven that is equivalence relation. So it just is approved things. Like I'll just do symmetry quickly for I'll pay for all be so we want to show that ARB and Plies pra and this one is Just Like Heaven by the definition rights we have  FFA equals FMB doesn't imply that f a b equals F of a check and then and then equality itself is symmetric. So you're done.  What's the number to so we have one? So first let's see what this what this function actually does. Maybe just without any of the scenarios. We have a function.  And that function map some stuff from A to B. Then what are cool insulation is doing is it boxing things in a into equivalence classes based on whether they map to the same element of be?  Eagle that can be midas's that's a that's B and that right there is at the day and it's also a movie  so if a is finite  And it's partitioned into a equivalent size of a equivalence classes. The only way to split a finite set into size of that sat equivalent classes is to make every equivalence class have only one element.  It's so unlike the picture up top. This picture has only one element for equivalence class.  And now we have RB and now because of the definition of our equivalence classes. Well, we can't actually if we ever tried to draw two arrows to the same one that knows when to come the same equivalence class.  San Diego "
