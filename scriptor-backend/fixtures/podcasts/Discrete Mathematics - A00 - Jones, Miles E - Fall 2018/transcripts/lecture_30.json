    "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Yeah.  Adidas  for problem 1D  Is it a second solution?  Oso, okay 1B I know  But I can explain by Sophia.  Okay. So one day does anyone have any doubts how to convert binary to octal to Binary hexadecimal in decimal?  So the main idea and that question is that when you have to convert and also to finally take each symbol of the ox and converted into a funny three-bed binding, Co 44217.  You can turn what's 7 to 1 1 1 1 2 0 0 1 2 2 0 1 0 + 4100 + 1 in binary. It's exactly how in decimal and hexadecimal you convert every hazardous symbol to a 4-bit binary options. You can wear to a tree with Bentley symbol and for the second one, you need to convert that to hexadecimal. Now, you can combine for four bits from the right-hand side and then give the corresponding. He's got us in December and for any of the computed values and then just converted to a decimal by taking the powers of that particular.  8 oz in 1/8  Okay, super 1B.  Okay. So for 1B the question is finding a positive integer greater than 1 which makes the following equation true.  So now you can see in the equation the maximum number which is used is for so definitely your base has to be greater than equal to fight Elizabeth lesson that you cannot have those digits, right? So let's say our base was 3 the maximum digital you can have is to 2012 should be the only digits in the equation. But the equation has numbers 2/4 to be assured that our base has to be greater than or equal to 5.  connect  Okay, so I'm going on now. Let's look at the the last place of the last column of the left hand side, which is 3 + 407 but that is getting converted to base in the basement is getting tonight to one. So what we can see that that is going to happen for only two cases 137 in decimals and gets converted to 21 in base 3.  How can you write that the 7 to 21 and Over?  yeah, and 7 in decimal 1-0 gets converted to  21 in base 3 and 7 in decimals and gets converted to 11 in basics.  So far these two bases, you can see that that last column 7 is getting converted to the last column of one which means now you have two options 3 and 6, but he always figured that the base has to be greater than or equal to fight. The only option left is 6 now, we can substitute the values. I mean substitute the value of b s 6 in your left hand side and you see that is equivalent to the right hand side in Basics. So the right answer is b c equal to 6, you can also do I do that in this way to force you expand your equation by Stan Smith and then you get a cubic equation and then you find the values of the base B flat equation. And then again, you can find a devalue of Vizio to 6%. Equation that is satisfied until 6.  And out to the pho spot.  Okay. So the second question is that are there other valid solutions for be so there are no real solutions. Why because now you three plus four was 7 which is a so that we don't have to be has to be greater than or equal to 5 and 4 bases larger than 7 + 7 + 3 + 7 what happened to the Nez 7 and not converted to be to one in business.  Could I be getting that so if the last column Sam 3 + 4 7 + 7 was a possible symbol in that base then your last column wouldn't have been converted to collect. So now the only possible value left as a video to 6 and we cannot have any of the value which was a sad situation.  So basically we found a lower bound and upper bound and be and then we found a solution for be and then you prove that there are no other issues.  So in an equation we had for as the maximum symbol that was used by now. If the base was less than 5 lets it was for you cannot have food in your symbol, right? You have bases to one of the only possible symbols that you can use 0 and 100 in the same way. If you want for to be dead in your system, you have to have base greater than 441 be allowed in the symbol. Right? Like for example, you have the last Simba's you cannot use anything which is better than that exactly like that.  Yes.  Okay. So one see it's already simple one to want to go to school table.  I think it's okay so far want to see it's just drawing the truth tables for BTV to B10. And whenever the value is a multiple of 3 we get it down put up one and otherwise we give it to you. So basically 4 values 0 2 0 3 6 9 12 15 in a decimal spell have ones and the rest of the Rose Adizero and then the question is asking to draw a circuit. So you have lesser rows with value wants to use DNA and converter to table into the corresponding logic formula and then you get the logic circuit.  It's a very simple one you've done such questions in your homework as well any doubts in this one?  Okay, yeah.  The dnf so it's not necessary. You have to simplify. But if you really need to you can so if so, you see that six jobs in the dnf if you fix roses at 1 to 1 and you can combine the first two rows and take the common date be 3 and b 2 coming out. So you have an ought with Rihanna not be too in your first and second job. If you take that out, you'll be left with eggs or of B1 and b0  Supposed to get simplify to 1/2 1 using the same approach. You can take common B3 and be to join the first two rows you get nordvpn on me too, in the last two years between be too, and similarly in the middle of the road. You can take to get to combine 2 3 I'll be easier for you to draw the logic circuit, but it's unnecessary to do that. You can really just draw a really big logic succulent.  Any more questions on this one?  Sorry.  So you mean for drawing the largest arcade, did you just have to draw?  Yeah, so flustered all the food table and then you see which Rosa 1-0 if you have more ones with a dnf if you have more zeros lyrics enf get the Farmland to the logic.  Is that the question?  So you want to use like DNS and get the jacket with or in the middle and then and now photos each between B2B 1 B 0.  Yes.  One solution is visible to 6 but there are no other Solutions.  Okay, so we found that the hospital and he will understand that and then we also saw that B has to be less than 7 why because I let her lie because when 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 it's not giving you seven in the last place but one says getting to do something right. So if we had our base greater than 7 it would have been having seven in the last column and not want.  Yep, they found me.  Okay, so now let's go want to question 2.  ABCya Seminole, I can tell you the basic approach behind it. So for answering the first question that which of the formulas are tautology contradiction of contingency. You can just draw the truth table and you'll get your answer but in the last column  So if anyone wants to check that answers, the first one was a contingency second one was the second one was also a contingency and third one was.  I need a list of the first part 4 Spider-Man how to get a weather Witch of the formulas are.  Surplus second part  Viva Das to find a logically equivalent formula in dnf now once you have your two tables, you know how to get you just see which Rosa one and you can work that into the corresponding tnf.  so  will see for the first one.  Yeah, and the Rihanna.  some of the first one you have not pee or  B&B Ice Cube  So now you can see there are three rows which are true and so will have three three rockets. So basically or of 3 + communities  Sophia and Q or not p&q or not be and not you. So if y'all Indiana table and get the equal, Indiana, you can also avoided to table if you want and convert the given equation into a smaller one by using the logical equivalence rules that you have and then you'll have to get the corresponding the NFL game by using some logical equivalence shoes. And that's a possible solution to buy. This is easier one.  Yes.  Okay, I need Alex for the second question.  Yes.  That which one?  Oh, so that's that's that's for your convenient. If you can please fine.  But I would suggest that you have another calling for not be if not better than your solution. It's possible that you do I mistaken them to a table and then you Deanna close to go wrong. So might as well just add another column is video for YouTube.  August animal that's in the second one.  Okay. So for the third one, we have to express each of the following statements using quantifiers variables oppositional connectives and predicate.  Send the first one we have if Amazon integer and square + n + 1 is all so when was solution is you say that your domain for m is integers. You define a predicate. Let's save the effects FedEx's or so the sentence will become.  If m is an integer until December 23rd, so basically for all integers descendants Carlos, and that's why I thought so you can say for all MD of Amsterdam to fly.  Does OnePlus One case or you can drive that your domain for?  LMAO is all real numbers and you can Define to Connecticut where let's say zeref x x is an integer and the effects is M squared + 10 + 1 is odd and then even say that that affects implies B affect that's one case or you can just directly right that Domaine is integers.  Okay. So once you are done writing the equation you have to prove whether the segments and the statement on its negation is true. So we will try proving a statement statement first. So now we know that Amazon integer not have to prove if the landscapers and this one is all done. So if it's an integer now, it'll be either or or even there two cases. Correct? So far us what you can do is you substitute M as some too cute letter M is even first so you supposed to do with the volume for MS to Q in your equation for Q squared + 4 q  Apopka square + 2q + 1 squared + 2 Q is definitely evil because you can say yes.  Yeah, but this one yes.  So so the new cases that are easy that even allowed to take the purse case, when is evenly substitute the value of Ms. To culinary creation Now for two squared + 2 Q is definitely even if you can take two coming out of that and she was an indie. So that leaves us with even plus one which gives you a phone number.  Correct stove for the case when I miss even your answer the simplest one Elite to be out now. Let's take the other case with Amazon. So you'll just have to do with MSM to Q Plus One in your equation.  and when you evaluate that you get  city guide for Q squared + 4 q + 2 Q + 2 + 1 now from the first part 2 coming out and you are left with plus one.  URF plus one at the end.  but if you have focus camera Spokeo + 2 + 3  now the first part is again even and you are left with plus one. So that gives you an odd number so we can prove that for all integers X Curtis.  Okay in the any questions, yes.  Sew-in sew in list of you question paper. It was specified that you cannot use any any equation that approve in the class. You have to have to prove it to you do have in the exams.  new dinosaur  heroes in a book and exam  So, okay.  They got everything just like for example a proving and squares for every end with a sword and scale is also what you need to do that I need to do.  Okay so far.  Okay now, let's see question. B3b.  Garden dishes and children 5 to n minus 1 is not trying so we can define a predicate V of X where X is Prime and your domain can be all integers. So descendants will convert 2 for all and 5 implies implies. Not of fear of tuition - 1  address to n - 1  yeah, so that's the statement and now we observed that the negation is actually true for the negation of that statement becomes that exist and n.  yeah, like  Okay, so then I guess you know the statement becomes that exists and and and you have ended in five and below to determine which means that end this exists and integers such that the integers greater than 5 + 2 is 4 - 1 is prime so for proving the negation to be true, you just have to find one integer without us by this equation. And if you said videos and as 7 You observe that it is indeed trying so students to 7-1 is a 128 - 127 which is a prime number. So you were able to find such an integer which 405 and Western -1 was Prime. So y'all negation is true and it makes a statement to be false.  You don't have to prove that.  Before what?  I'm so for checking if it's a prime or not. You have to check only to the \u221a 127 to know that right. So it's so you can take an approximate \u221a 127 lb definitely be more than 11 and Pleasant Run Samsung. You have to check only 4 numbers from one to trust which is easy, right?  Okay, any more questions than this one?  Okay, so full question C.  The set of even integers is closed under subtraction. So what this question means is that  how to set up and teachers of any two integers in this set when subtracted it also gives an even integer so we can convert this equation into a statement. So let's say our domain is integer and we have a predicate effects, but I can't even so now I'll send in your face and your fight in place of x minus y that is if accident so the effects it has any one individual and wise an even integer then x minus y is also this means that the set of even integers closed under subtraction, so don't even integers and subtracted should also result in an even integer.  So that's how you never been descendants.  And now we have to prove that this is true. So that's really simple you can take eggs as to pee and a Vie as 2q. So the difference would be to be - 2q and you can take to comment which is to price of him and ask you which is also an even number 10 screw.  8 hours fitness  Yes.  fetty WAP  oh, yeah, there is a symbol is that  Yeah.  Okay.  so far question 3 question 4  Yeah, so that's your question. It states that you was only method definitions and gender. Decision approved. Do not use any results proven class or text me llamas. So the hotel rooms are fine. But dilemmas are not the ones that you can use.  Okay. So for the first one your question is the difference of an irrational number and an irrational number is irrational.  So we can do this by saying about using proof by contradiction. Let's say that the difference of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational number so we know that one number is rational numbers irrational so we can represent let the X and Y are the two numbers that we are using we can represent X as some may by be because all rational numbers are integers. So now  Exeter presented as a baby and you know that the difference is also irrational. That's what we are assuming for now. So x minus y Steve IQ.  So why becomes x minus x minus y and when you substitute the values?  You get a q - BP is b q.  But you know that this is the form of rational number. It's the form of a m i n which means you are getting that when x + x - wife were rational by also turned out to be a rational number. And hence. This is a contradiction of what are exemptions that why is it rational and therefore by contradiction that doesn't even twist?  Yes.  flight  so if it's if it's not irrational, it's I mean if it's  are there any more questions in this month?  Yes.  Is that what?  X is equal to a baby and the baby and you're also assuming that the difference is also rational number that buy BBQ and then we prove that by also turned out to be a rational number since it was represented in this phone.  Okay, so you were out in the first one?  Okay, so far full be.  The question is if a b c are integers and a squared plus b squared c squared then at least one of A and B is so now we can prove by contradiction.  So, let's see both A and B are on.  So, okay.  So avoid NBR or we have a is a 2 m + 1 + B is 2 + + 1.  so we can substitute these values in our equations to a squared plus b squared is equal to  So you get 4 x 4 x x squared + m + 10 squared + 10.  Plus two so that's what is the letters inside value is equal to c squared. Okay. So now let's consider two cases. Let's save see is even and fees.  Turn off of the first Casey's or Fino SC square or has to be or so the equation that we are getting is actually an even number because you can take to come out of this number definition.  So  Okay. So if OKC is on this is not true because we are getting an even number to see if he can be us. So now the other case Westie is even nice easy, even then B is divisible by to collect Suzy square has to be divisible by 4.  play  because if C is of the phone to Q Nancy squares of the phone for Q square right now what we are getting in-state is 4 * 17 + 2 * the song don't know this we know is definitely know why because the first part is divided by four and what's your remaining with is to which is not divisible by 4. So your sister is actually not divisible by 4, which means he cannot be even as well. So that gives you a contradiction which means A and B both can be ordered.  Because otherwise see is you otherwise, you're not able to find any value for Steve italicize equation.  Yes.  No, you cannot do.  You can specify something like as protein discussion.  Okay any questions in this month?  Let's move to the next question.  Okay, so we have for any integer.  N squared + 5 is not divisible by 4.  So again, we can have two cases and is all in the NL and is even so if we have and it's even then you can see that end square is also going to be even plus 5 result in an odd number. So definitely an odd number is not going to be there by 4.  So n is even is not possible.  Now we want to ending or it can be represented as 2K + 1 + in your equation.  okay, so you get when you substitute the value of an s2k plus one in the equation you get 4 x k squared + 3 + 1 + 2 again, this is of the form of the previous question where you can see that the first part is if my phone because you can take for coming out but the second part remainder is to which is not divisible by 4 and means and Sky Plus 5 is not even when it is so we can talk about all the cases for friend and that for our equation is  Any questions at this one?  So an outlet or is even but how do you prove whether it's visit before or not?  You have to poop so it is written that.  Northern you can assume that that is closed.  It is a certain summer in the ocean that it's not.  Are you going to do nothing without you?  Okay, so let's go into the deep part 2 the questions.  Oh, okay, okay.  AR  Do you want to switch off that flashlight setting instant visa to see think so.  No.  Joey Badass lyrics  Okay, I'll I drive.  Okay, so far 5D the question is for all positive integers a b c if it does not divide BC that does not divide be so we can find a position. That is we say that if a divides B then a divides BC so  Yep.  Maybe it was okay.  Later on.  Don't start from the top.  Okay, Sofia saying that a divides B. So by definition of divisibility we have B is a multiple of 8 so we can ride that as busy with some 8K for somebody know if B is equal to a K-1 Visa value becomes see which is a x Casey. And again, it's a multiple of a & Hennessy proof that a divides b c as well, so  Okay.  Yeah.  Spell contribution is that if a divides B then a divides BC advice because of which begat be a sequel to a kid is a multiple of 8 gave her some Valium.  Now what BC value stores be substituted value of b l a k not equation. So we get a k e x c which can be written as a x Casey. Does BC is a multiple of 8 that is very Kacey is some number and therefore a device BC.  Answer your prove that if a divides B then a divides b c song by contraposition yourself in salsa fruit.  Any doubts in this song?  Yes.  8 * 3 is what?  But how do you prove that 70 show?  That's okay then and then k x c /  play ABC Rhymes age.  Even if you're not even decide on the solutions, all the solutions are going to be posted right after the review session Solutions.  Yeah.  So, how did you do that?  Okay.  if a divides B then  bright  Yeah, it's fine.  Okay, so any but I was in the fourth question.  Okay, so let's go on to the first one.  Lourdes true age of the following statements for all sets A and B the power set of the Union of our set of A and B is equal to power set of a union B.  So this statement is false and you can prove that by giving a corn counterexample to let these set it is just one element. That's one and set B is element 2 ^ a  University of BB guns  empty set set of eight one set of two instead of that.  Yeah, so that's the union of our sets of A and B. Now a union B is the sad one, to the power set of dad said becomes empty said set one set of students at 1, to the element. One, two is not present in this set, and then we can say that it's not equal.  So you can see that in the union of A and B power set.  So the last element set 1, 2 does not exist in the union of power sets of each of each ANB and hence. They are not violent.  Phases accounting example for your question and therefore this statement is false.  So question be  do we have for Allstate Cindy P of a intersection B of DSP of a bar instead of a intersection B. So this so for proving that the two things that you can balance you need to prove that left inside. Is it cold right hand side as well as the other alarm.  Okay, so  Okay, so a purple rain guards the intersection of power set of A and B is equal to power set of some element X is Frozen in power set intersection power said be so Cynthia saying is better than the intersection. It means that it exists in both power set of 8 and Powerful of be so extra long to power set of 8 as well as X belongs to power Serebii.  connect now if you're saying that X belongs to power set of a it means that X is some subset of a  and since it also belongs to have a set of Beats begin say that X is also a subset of B.  So if x is a subset of a as well as beef it means it is present in an intersection B has went right because it says call me subset.  So now if x is opposite of intersection be it will be present in the power set of intersection B.  Text to Dad completo. Now we're yes.  Flights Vegas we have to assume one part and then to the other part, right?  So the question is that intersection of our sets is equal to the power set of the infection. So we have to assume that if if x belongs here are the next ultimate on sale, so  Yeah, because that's what I'm trying to prove right you're trying to prove that electrons in equal to all just so for every element X, which is existing in the intersection, which is an 11-sided you're trying to pull that it also exists in the right side.  Yeah. Yeah. So for the second half we say that let X be sorry be any element which belongs to the power set of a intersection B is a subset of intersection B. Now. I've exited of intersection B. It means that X is common to both A and B, which means example of it as well as a subset of B, which means and be present in the Bible said it as well as supposed to be and since I'm element is present in the deposit. It will definitely belongs to that intersection. And therefore you prove that if it is the element for any element which is present in the bathroom and affection meme also be present in the intersections of the power set of each set.  Any dachshund is fun.  Okay, so let's go on to the next one.  3/2 foot any set ABCD is a Cartesian product a Crosby and secrecy are disjoint then either incident joint or B & B are disjoint or both.  So we can prove this organ is a true statement. We can prove this by contrapositive. So be as you that intersection C is not disjoint and detection Dee is also known as joint. So basically you're saying that there is some element is common during D&C and that is some element of the scum between B&D not the intersection of rain does A + B + C + B is also not design.  It's not empty.  Azumane deficiency is not empty. And then the section that is not disjoint. And if B dissection do you spell turn on disjointed then we get that intersection b in a class B intersection C Class B is also not distress. So from our predicate party have in deficiency is not empty. So that is some element X which belongs to intersection C. Similarly we have which belongs to be in the section d  Now sis X belongs to intersection c x is coming in both NC there for Xbox to a as well as X belongs to see.  And similarly Falls by since it belongs to the intersection of DnD. It is coming with the sets that will buy belongs to be as well as where I belong swing.  so  Deadpool  Now we have X belongs to a 3-prong to A & C boat and why belongs to vnd but to no X, by the definitely belong to a class B X belongs in a and Y belongs in be so we have a fan X, Y in the Cartesian product of A and B & Y belongs to be today for the FedEx, Bible also belong to the Kardashians Biloxi trustee.  so  So you have that each pair of the barracks, lies longing to be secretly by.  because X belongs to  I seen what you get from this equation since its present an intersection of ACL be present in a LLC and similarly belongs to be as well as this and if you have a FedEx, life in the garden products of a Christian tee, grizzley, and therefore it will be present in the intersection of 2 since it's common in bodyguard Netflix.  Any doubts in this one?  Yes.  XNXX  Just want to let difference between the big axles.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wiretap, which is the setting of The Power.  So every element X has subset of a dissection. Sylvia saying that every element in eggs will also be present in the power set because that's what the definition of satisfied you have. Every you haven't said for each and every element and yeah.  Yes, but intersection B is results and instead right? It's not just an element. It's the complete set of that element. So even if there was just one element x 8 section B would be the set of that says I should have said  How is everything?  Yes, correct.  MacGyver Lexus  Exercise the everything in the power set of a intersect B is a 7.  If you have a power, yeah.  We don't say that.  Yeah, it's a big.  But it's okay. So I understand if you're saying that X is President and we both okay, so we are saying that belongs to intersection be but when you find out the intersection of angle sets is results in Aztec. So even if it's an element will give you a set in in return.  has an element  Correct.  Yeah, but we're having internet x-small exponents about set vs ain't got stuck talking about the capital x-ray.  Yeah, but that that's not okay. So choose with the debatable. So when you saying that in the first line when you say that an element belongs to power serve an eviction be that element is actually spent all the elements of power set of Education of our sets with obesity a set rate.  Yes, the first statement it says the saying there's some set which belongs to a barber set is it can be determined?  Yeah, it's it's been because of the variables I guess.  How's that was supposed to say yeah.  anyone doubts still question C  TOEFL question D. We have there are sets a, b such that it belongs to me and a subset of B.  So in order to prove the statement to be true example, which satisfies this statement exists such that it belongs to me and you so we can give  So the difference between belongs to and stop that is that when you say a belongs to be it means that is the whole set has to be an element of the set be an amusing is a subset of B. It means it means that all elements in set a have to be present in the side B.  So far this example we have a is a set of 1, 2 and Visa said 1/2 and the third one, too, so we can see that set a 1, 2 is itself an element of Saturday, which means that it belongs to be and we can also see that is a subset of Levi because all the elements in it that is one and two are also president be so you have 1 and 2 in b as well, so we have shown that that is that I said States and B such that they belonged a belongs to be as well.  Yes.  So your statement is that that exists a set and B such that this question aside, so it's enough to give an example.  If it would have been dead for all sets a, b.  Yeah.  Okay. So the last one we had any questions for this one.  So if you have Visa power set of eight you weren't you going through? That is absolutely right because you will not have one and two separate elements. You will have a set of wine instead of to write.  Yeah.  So is actually not a subset of our survey.  Okay, so far question is empty and section c is also empty infection be in section c is empty so we can prove the statement. I just giving account example, so let's take it as one, two BS too, 3 sower Blvd to now we have fears instead of the lemon tree. So B intersection C becomes 3, and so we can see that in the section B and C deficiency. Both are not disjoint is empty and the section c  Yeso in the section V was too and see is Elementary. So to intersection 3 is empty so we can see that even though intersection B & B intersection C were not and you got an addiction be in the section c is as empty so your statement is false because you proved one side was false false.  any questions  Okay, so, let's see the sixth one.  Okay. So the question is starting with a large collection of same size squares control possible shapes that can be formed by placing Square so that each new Square shares an edge with at least one PVC play square square develop an action the number of quest to the development of the ship is always even no matter how many squares a place or how they are arranged. So the basis that would be that you just put one square. So let's say the the length of the side of a square is some value case and there was a part of me that would be 4K which is even though your biscuits is done.  Take someone available for the side or something shape which was formed using case quiz had even integer. Now, we need to prove that if we are placing one was Square in this the perimeter is still even so therefore cases for this either the square will be placed by sharing just one edge with a square or by sharing two edges or by sharing tree or bush reading for edges.  Can you see that happening, right? Okay. So now let's take the first case where it says one is so when you share one Edge, the parameter gets reduced by K and Indians incremented by 3 * k.  connect  so let's say you had some.  Foam squares randomly now, I'm adding one square.  The Bellamy the was originally selected we had this the parameter originally was.  APK  now we're going to add a square.  The better meet the Des Edge was first proposed BAC present in the parameter that gets removed, but you are now adding.  Cricket in your parameter, so you get this.  We just sent you which is also even which is an even number. So therefore this is again a better man, even for the case one.  now Focus to  Let's see if we have.  Yes. That's SK was yes. You have a question.  Yeah, because if One Direction is false, then you don't need to.  Play but the equation says that this part supposed to be satisfied for all sets a b and c a b c for which the statement was false false today.  So you are thinking you were considering some particular case of C for which the statement balance with troop. That's what you're doing.  What's the question?  black  Yeah.  Right, so that's what I'm saying. So if you want to prove that P if and only if Q is false, if you prove that the implies Q is false automatically become spots.  You can't do that if you pull one direction for moving the same as well.  new One Direction  no matter what the opposite direction.  If you do we have an addiction to when you hit a little even though.  p double implies Q  Okay, so  So, is that it?  bwwm flies Q can be written as  on Q implies Secret  Is that right?  Let's to know if I want this statement to be true. I want this and this but if I approve any of these to be false.  When does statement remain true?  I know, right?  So what we did is peaches from one side V force one side weevils.  Okay, so  Play some even for me but Imma space find her now that's a case to where we are. The square such that it says two sides. So if it's about sharing two edges.  The baby that might get Reduce by two k's and then will be added by two keys. So that's basically a parameter Remains the Same even if it's right in the middle of the diagram, where is not selling any of the perimeters then the perimeter one change address again it Stay Schemin.  Bledsoe Avenue. Perimeter of case was even that that's according to our interaction hypothesis And The Fool by adding a square which has two edges it against a season by because y'all better media gets reduced by 2 and then I'd still get that invite to slice of us.  Not going to talk. Peace, but it says 3 address.  death  shut  I said this one foot most fun case one now. Let's say we have  so  So Sylvia, assuming that this is an induction hypothesis. This is the part of me that which is already even now. We're adding a square such that it's just wanted to touch base 1 hs2. I just thought I'd say I had a square here.  That's okay stew.  Yeah, and I should have bought this is  So now our Focus to this can be an example. Where you at a square, which is the best way to reduce by two and added by 2. So it's him. It's amazing how far  let's say we had to send that to this was your interaction hypothesis. Now, you have to add a square here.  So it shows Three Ages.  play story of Alameda gets reduce Patriots and  Adam by 1's, so it gets reduced by twice of s which is even and parameter of cave is already an even number.  so  the new parameters of semen the last case you can have an example.  This was induction hypothesis.  So it's shedding all edges.  So this will happen only when it's somewhere in the middle. So it's actually won't contribute to the parameter a. So, the parameter will stay the same as that was for perimeter of case.  Oh, yeah. Yeah, you can do that even so it's mine is so but if we just gave us even and you subtract in full dress with again even  Yeah, that's just to show you the example, but you can actually draw a diagram which has all four paws the full between cases in some and not the other.  No.  Okay, so  Right. So basically we're done with all the cases and you prove that these are the only possible cases of adding is adding a square and you put for each case that the new parameter is stinky NFL by induction you prove depression.  That's not allowed in the question right to the question says you can add Square only when it says at least one is with you.  That is not exist.  mathematical induction  It is v a zoomed that something is truthful K and we are adding kabbes won its region definition.  Okay, so far question 7.  Yes.  Oh, so I assumed so be said that.  So just that I didn't see so we assume that 4K squares the perimeter was even say so it should be off the phone to see some just so I substituted that.  So that still give an estimate and you can take two, So this also even just to show that it's even it doesn't have.  Sobo question 7  did I set up with strings s recursively by basic steps zero belongs to us and the Regatta step is that affects belongs to us than XX also belongs to us special nachshon. I put every X number of bits in. X is also by the power of 2.  So now for such an option you have bases step that zero belongs to us. Now. The number of bits in zero is one which is a power of 2 that is so the basis that is true.  Now we want to go to go to step. So we are doing that. We have some string W which belongs to the set s and we assume that the number of elements in this string W is about horsepower of W-4 about of two so we can say that the number of elements in this WSAZ.  No FEMA want to go another step. That is we have another element now ww.w. The length of dance will be the length of w Platteville end of WW2 that distress 2K + tourist. Okay, which is slice of the ways to get which is today's UK plus one. So we prove that the number of elements a number of bits in the new springform ww.w is also a power of 2 and Hands by induction you prove that all elements have the number of bits about  so the more defects  is actually the length of the string.  So here you can see that the new string that he had ww.w is actually so the length of the movie length of WW2 by students today, and then that'll be to visit a plus one, which is the power set about 3 to the power of 2, and hence you prove by induction that all elements will have the length of a lawsuit.  any belts  Okay, so let's go on to the eighth one.  Which positive integer values can be found using only $0.07 and $0.02 coins? And so which is the least number which is English can be formed with 7.  Not the least bit then so from that in detail all languages are any integer less than 6 cannot be found by using 2 + 7y because you can definitely come all the even integers by using just a to send coins, but for an odd integer, you need some or denomination and the smallest denomination. I do have a 7-2 definitely count from 1 3 or 5 years.  Yeah.  Yeah sex is the answer.  Tell you what.  Yeah, either you say that or you say that it's good when you go to 6 it's a thing.  right  basically anything starting from 6, so you can ride that are scarier than five or six flags. It's the same thing. So you just going to let me go to 6.  Now the second question is the second part is that you have to figure and stuff. So the bases step would be that you can make $0.06 using 3 to send coins and you can make $0.07 using 17 set point correct now for all the other teachers, you can just subtract 2 and get the previous anticipated. We are in Dr. Hypothesis would be glad you have you confirm your business doubled repeat of 6 and 3 of 7.  And it's definitely strong induction because you're using more than one base case year.  Lights of biscuits is original Cavs trading for the biscuits.  Okay, so, you know that you can form all the even integers right so you can form 2 4 6 8 all the even integers by using just to send coins collect.  But for all integers, you need one at least one or denominator or denomination going right?  Like for example, if you want to form set a 3 Center 3, how what how can you do so you can use a $0.02 fine? But what about the last one sandwiches remaining you need an order nomination for that today? If you can not found that using just to send coins.  Now which is the smallest or denomination that you have?  Seven so you think that's the least or number which can form is 7 and before that doesn't even integers sex. You can also found that but you cannot form five by using a $0.07 denomination.  connect  Flights to hear the hypothesis that we are assuming that we have p a p i can pee 6 to PKR to be true and which means fear of K - 1 is also true now if you want to find if I walk + 1 is Flo not what we can do is we can take the answer of K - 1 and add to send going to that which proves that be. Okay, if the Sun is also true.  Okay, so I need electrolytes and how it is that lets say T minus one is some point of two cent coin and stamp coins of assembly 2007 Sandpoint. Now if you want to find weather Cape plus one can be found with 2 and 17.3 substitute, 2A + 70 and add a two-cent coin. So we get price of a plus one plus seven be so basically will need a plus one coins of $0.02 and we coins of $0.07 to Pompey of cable phone and you prove that you are able to form all the coins. Kehlani go to Six Flags in 2017 coins.  Any questions in this one?  Yes.  So you're not talking about a ride, so I'm going to a city.  So the question is what the video going to be correct. It is important just evolved form using this point so  It's basically we are asking as whether if the greedy algorithm is something like you have you want to phone some integer? Let's say it would be to just give coins one by one by what we will do is first give the big of an envelope with one. So we're stuck because you don't have any more points left to the greedy algorithm is basically forced air heating all the the larger denominations and then using it one by one and getting the other point.  Yes of the greedy algorithm contribution of should be certified.  Yes.  Because you cannot form five.  Right, but you need to find the base case from which all numbers can be formed. Right? Otherwise, if you say that I can pump to for 6 and then grilling steaks. He won't be able to prove by induction have my song induction died.  So you can song five you gone from 3. You can someone the question asks, which integer values can be found. If you want to buy that the indigenous to 4 and then you just get a new phone and then you prove separately for 2 and 4 and then for all numbers.  Yeah, but 531 kannada song. Yeah.  It wouldn't be because if you have to eat, so if you give $0.07 to this 8 you'll be left with one and you can form so you get stuff so it doesn't work.  So all better than six was acquired, but if you don't want for it's fine, but you got you want your mouth.  So actually even if you didn't go to the is not specified is fine. Why because it can be either of the two options that it will be either you keep on giving $0.07 first and then you give 2 or 2 cents for 10 and 7. So let's say we have the phone. Let's take two examples one.  Where you have to Phone 8 and one we have to phone 92048. Let's take the the first person that is giving the largest denominations first. So he gets $7 left with one which we cannot form. So we get stuck together, but  42 San Andreas talking with one which one work  So then I think if you're doing a customized video got some you if you specify. Like if you want to say that I'm assuming that this man and this is correct about that.  Yeah.  Adam Adam that you fix the order first and then we'll always save the first denomination that order and if you are not able to give dance song.  Okay anymore. Still question it?  Oh, that's nine to do that. Yeah.  Okay, so 498 me to prove it to the function is 20123 and you're f of x as X Mart 5 and we have to prove that is not verifying the function is not well-defined. Why because 4 Less a half of 4.  Your function would be fair for Maroon 5, but it doesn't exist in your codomain and if you spell qualify.  The function would have been well-defined if your codomain would have had 0 1 2 3 4.  Since it's a mod V.  Any question to the first one?  So basically you got you got to take any example of which modifiers for and then you can prove that. It's not really fine. Let's say you have a 14 again 45 is 4 and 4 is not Learning Academy.  Okay.  So far Part B. The function is that the power set of positive integers is map to integers and FFA is the maximum element in it.  So this is not well defined by because F of positive integers is not verifying why because even though you don't know the element of that. So what value will you give to a puppy?  You don't really know the maximum element of deposit setup in theaters.  madibella snorkel Define  We have one too many.  So it should be the set of wine, too because it's it's the set of its. I think it said.  Light at every other element of the power set of that letter we have one too. So you have empty 1/2 and 1/2 or a subset of 1, 2.  So if if so if in the insides conviction, what you can do is write an adoption shelter in this way, and then you prove your answer.  Okay. Now for question see there's a one-to-one function with domain a b c and codomain are  so if he just Define of Antoine function we are done. So let's say that f of x is  It's already been a function in this River above is 1fl please to FFC street. Now you can see this is one to one because no element in the domain is mapping Amendola go to me and  yep, so you have to find a one-to-one function and that's what it's asked.  And also one two, three all exist in the Golden Age of real numbers show.  Any questions in the Sun?  Yeah.  But you need to solve the question says that there is a one-to-one function. So it's better if you existed.  The next one is it is an onto function with domain 01 charcoal to make pie, 1-17. So again, you can define a function something like let's say for every F of wfrv ww.w starts with 0 and 1 by 17 otherwise, so this function is one-to-one. Why because you know that all the strings in the dome in the 01001.  Yeah, so if you need to show that all the elements in your domain get map to at least one element so we know that the element in so all the newest movie starting either with zero or one there's no other case. So if it's it's starting with 0 value of pi and every value in the domain  Yes Auto V having an otherwise, right? So if it's empty or doing one by 17  517 have some free images of  Okay, so far question, you have the Cartesian product of positive integers cross a, b, c is countable now. What is it that isn't productive positive integers with a, b, c. It's actually the union of Cartesian product of the positive set of integers with a  Ww.w. Union with the positive integers of that Crosby again that you didn't trust see.  Text now for every integer in the positive integers. You have a pair in each and each of those blankets. So now we know that the laundry in five nights. So the number of the pairs of with the with the first element of positive integer and the Second Amendment gave it all so we can so it's a union of three to be in five nights this which is also going to be in five nights at in there for you prove that the garbage in the whole Cottage breakfast ideas.  Canada has what?  So, that means it's so accountable means it's going to be the final.  It's just sitting out the question right? It's basically the same thing.  So if you have  so if you see the Cartesian product of this is me 14243 for and the garbage out of this is B15 to 535 Civic the union isn't that dance?  bed, and it's basically making  Yeah, it's me. Taking each element and Performing the Cartesian product with the previous set. Yeah. Yeah, so we did that just so that he can see easily that we know that this is going to be in five nights at the number of face in this will be equivalent to the number of select. The Cardinal of this is actually  Yes.  comfortable  Okay, so I found this question in jaundice.  So if you want to prove that it's going to be you should try to find either bijection or you try to see if the cardinality is equal to the Cardinals National. That's what's Happening Here We prove that the cardinality volume to the cardinality of  I need a question.  Yeah.  Survivor auction would be from this set to the set of natural numbers something like that.  any more questions  Set timer.  Bob's discount for Amazon want to the  I think that.  Yeah, everything is fine. If you just say that you're going to be gone when she's gone to visit because it's fine and your dad place is going to be in find which means again is countable and then it makes sense. Yes.  Who beat bet if I so it means that for every element in your domain you have a well-defined image, which means that your image that exists in your codomain so so far the first kiss.  Can we have some silence please?  ISO for 9 if you see Fort was existing in your domain drive it with a set of integers for nausea.  Yeah, so so what VC that four numbers like 4 or 9 or 14? You don't have an amazing of CO2 mean for does not exist unicorn only has 0 1 2 3. The function would give a number which is not actually present.  ASAP forever question F we have the interval of real numbers 5 to 8 is uncountable and you may use the fact that the unit in GG.  Okay. So we Define a function is that W that affects is 5 + 3x?  11 spiders on 1st  Okay. So basically they're using the fact that zero to one is uncountable. So if we prove that there is a function from going from 0 to 1 to 528 Daniel Circle that 528 is uncountable. So we did the function f of x is 5 + 3x now, why does function well Define because so your ex is a number between 0 to 1 * 312 the situation you get 0 lesson 3 x + 3 + 3 + 5 + 3 x is between 5 to 8, which is Yoko domain and then. Well defined function now, we try to prove that. It's in Vaudeville.  so now you're trying to map five, 820, 1 n g f x 3X - 5 x 3  And then we show that the value of this OG / 5 / Envy X.  Get so basically you're trying to show that.  2021 if you're doing is uncountable n52, is also uncountable by showing that it's  Play so now I G FFX is basically substituting the value of f of x + 5 + 3x + your function g f x X - 3 so you get 5 + 3x - 5 3 Strikes by three witches XC get eggs again. And now we try to see if of G of x + 2 + 5 + 3x so you get 5 plus.  That which is also X.  That's basically proving Edison board with and so is a bijection and therefore you prove that it's unconscious.  So basically you prove that you were able to map. 12528 and since the new one is uncountable.  Yes.  all of the members in 02142  no, no.  The second set is greater than or equal to.  Say so you're saying that we are proving it's by Jack stauber election because we knew we know that.  5 to 8:35 to 8 to greater than or equal to.  Sew onto is so basically you are actually proving that you are able to map. So if you if you were able to 2528 does not make 5 to it. And then why because even if you had legs at a of function was just mouthing to to value of 35 in 6.  And that would not mean the five to eight is uncountable Right. Basically that be onto but not  okay.  Yeah, that is fine. You can define a function such a band.  animal question in the Sun  But that's about diction with the set of natural numbers. Right? So that's basically like if you know that a set is finite set a bijection with that would be account being fun spot if you know what that is.  Doesn't make sense.  It's basically like you if you know that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  Yes.  Okay sofa. 10th one.  Yes, it says Define turbine indeed Elation on the set of bit strings zero, one, which is an equivalence relation with 590 many distinct equivalence classes for the first one is thicker a dance classes because they're finite and for that photo Define your equivalence relation as xry. That's the normal edition. If and only if x is equal to Y is equal to an empty string.  X and Y a burden on MTN start with the same bit. So if they both start with zero Dia map to 18 vallance class if they both are empty than a map to the second equivalence class. And if they both start with one random act of violence class violence classes classes because they don't need to be possible cases SE. X and Y border MD by boat start with big 0 and either X and Y both start with bit one.  plate, so  As she's writing you get 3 gallons classes one is Lambda. When is 0x with the first British Beetle and extend anything 0 1 + 1 x. + what is 1 + x can I can be anything 0-1-0-3 Collins classes, MD 48041  tonight  any doubts for that?  So as you can see, she's our tendency to violence classes. She's listed it Lambda 0 x 0 the first bet I can be anything right after that because you're going to map the string which starts with 0 to that class. It doesn't matter what it is Alpha 0 and for the tortoise the bit starting with one and after that class and it's gone again be 0-1 ahead, but we only cared about the first because that's how I function defined. That's how it got its relation is defined.  Any doubts but duct.  Okay. I know it's a distinct balance relation is reflexive symmetric and transitive that's why it is an equivalence relation.  Okay. Now the beatbox it says you need to define equivalence relation with infinitely many distinct equivalence classes. Now this evening to find the function as X or Y if x is equal to Y. So, basically you went map those elements of the same equivalence class, which are equal.  So as you can see that it that I infinitely many gallons classes because the bit strings are going to be different right then I'm going to be the same to each of them will have its own equivalence class because none of them will be equal if they equal then them after the same equivalence class. But otherwise, I'd be infinitely many bit strings and they'll be infinitely many classes for each of those bit strange because none of them are equal.  right  So let there be like Infinity many kinds of mutations and then each of them will have its own advanced class. And since there are infinitely many bit strings that be infinitely many valence classes because that's only if they if they are equal.  So that's beat.  So it's basically it's basically one class is having this bit string.  Yeah, it's the class.  Yeah one collect. One two, three like it can be anytime.  Okay, and we be posting the solutions on Piazza and you can check the dissolution. It's still it's similar to what we've explained and in case you have any doubts, you can ask 20 oz or any other form of communication.
