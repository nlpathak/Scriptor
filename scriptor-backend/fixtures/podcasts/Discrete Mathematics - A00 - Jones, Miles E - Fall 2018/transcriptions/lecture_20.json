  "Full Transcript": "listening to a podcast  Okay. Good morning, everyone.  Let's get started today.  So what's in store for today?  functions  Good.  Where's my pen?  Might I find it a minute.  Kind of just had it.  Okay, what's in store for today?  functions basically functions  I'm hoping that you guys have seen him before right mainly you probably seen them in the sense of transferring.  Or talking about like algebraic equations, right? If you've ever taken a calculus classes you deal out with functions and the algebra class you do a lot with functions and a lot of the times you will turn a function into a graph right on the XY plane. That's kind of like a standard way to do it. So we're going to talk about functions kind of a more General and the more General sense in the in the sense that those functions I was talking about before are usually functions that map the real numbers to the real numbers. That's why you have the xy-plane write. The real numbers is 1 is the domain when is the coda mean we're going to talk more about just in general mapping one set to another set of function that takes one set to another set that said could be the real numbers could be the natural numbers could be a finite set.  Okay, so we're going to talk about domain codomain. We're going to talk about what it means to be one to one onto and bijective and those three concepts have a lot to do with the size of sets how to relate the sizes of sets together. Okay, so I don't know if we'll get to really the floor ceiling in factorial but we will talk about cardinality of sets and use functions as a way to compare the sizes of sets and you may want to just count the number of elements in the set and use that to compare the sizes, but we're going to encourage you to use functions to do it cuz we're going to define the  Comparing sets in terms of functions show you kind of what I mean.  Okay. So what are we what are we doing now is we have all these proof strategies? We have induction contradiction contrapositive by cases direct proof all of these things for the rest of the class. We're going to try to use those to prove certain properties about other.  Other mathematical Concepts stop really what's left is sizes of sets and number Theory and I will say that.  We did read through a lot in a we read through your your surveys and I know that one of the main themes was you know.  why are we only doing math, you know, some students would would like to see more of the link to computer science and  My answer to that is just everything we do in this class has a link to computer science and I apologize if I haven't liked made that connection, but I'm hoping in the future when you go into more advanced classes, you will see those connections coming into play, especially when you start taking 21 because that's going to do a lot of the things that you've done in this class and Link them to algorithm design. So I hope that I don't know if that's a satisfying answer but  I just hope that you understand this all of this stuff is kind of directing you towards these higher-level classes for you have to talk about data structures algorithms the steps of Fame.  Okay, I mean when we get to number Theory you're going to see the the direct connection to cryptography hashing these types of things that are applicable to security and that those types of things. Okay. So let's talk about a function. We have some vocabulary that we want to use function. You can also call it a mapping or a transformation. Those are all synonymous. What is a function?  Well, it's it's basically a way to map one set into another the set that your mapping from is called The Domain the set your mapping to is called the codomain.  And for function to be well defined you need this statement down here.  And now I really wish I had my pain.  DBC what I did with it.  I guess I can use this stylus.  Have a little awkward. But okay, let's go through this because there's a symbol in here that you may not have seen before.  ! Does anybody know what that means?  Okay good. So remember there exists backwards e is there exist?  this is  there  exists  backwards e! Is  there exists  exactly  1  okay, so it's true for one value and not any other value.  Okay. So what is this saying it's basically for all a a is in the domain right? This is I mean, this is basically what we've been doing before right if it's in the domain then it implies that there is one being the codomain such that F 8 is equal to be.  there exists exactly one being Dakota made FFA is equal to p  what that is saying is that you can't map one element to more than one element in Dakota made up for the codomain to two other things that always have to be from the domain to a unique element. Now, you can map many elements from the domain to one element in the codomain. That's fine. So  this shouldn't be super new. Okay. So, how do I how do I State this there exists a unique  B such that P of be okay, so let's just say p a b is some statement. How would I translate this into our  Notation with regular Universal quantifiers that we learned in week. What week 4  Okay, so there's exist to B such that P of B is true. Okay, so that's good right? But what else do you need you need and  For all what was it?  Okay, and for all see.  c not equal to be  implies  not not pissy sure.  questions about that  Or equivalently if you like.  He don't like to use negatives.  You can do it like this instead in this princesses put P of C implies.  PSE Madness this pain is kind of socks implies C is equal to be  and that's a that's a bad thing there.  C should be  you could just use the contrapositive.  Okay questions about that.  All right.  now  Let's talk about some operations on functions if if functions are numbers or numerical then you can talk about.  The addition and multiplication and the subtraction and division of two functions, right, but we can also talk about something called the composition of two functions. So  If F goes from B to C & G goes from A to B.  When you can talk about the function that is the composition of f e g. F composed with G and it goes from a to c because she is going to take A to B and you plug G inside of f so f is going to take B to C.  You guys have seen this stuff before with Calculus and chain Rule and all that kind of stuff.  Okay, so I'm in order to specify a function. We need three ingredients domain codomain and assignment.  So let's look at an example.  song  dark Liquors out  So our domain is going to be people right? Well, I guess there's two functions here. There's H and there's K, right so it let me let me do it like this.  H Sands  people to scores  NK sends scores to grades.  Right inside. This is how you usually write write the function you write function the function letter colon. And then you write. What is the what's the domain Arrow CO2 mean shop  What function Maps Alice to Alice gets a 90 and then a 90 translate to an a this is how we're going to not exactly this but this is sort of a way to think about how we assign letter grades to people we first assign you a numerical grade. And then we have a function that takes a numerical grade to a does the composition right? What did you guys say?  Okay, good. There's a lot of  which one is it is a h of K or is it K of H?  This is where it gets confusing Frank.  Remember that age of K or k of H. It's like you're putting once one function inside of another function Okay, so  Let's look at K of H.  of age of Alice  Prank, this is equal to K of H of Halas.  Bragged you guys remember how composition Works aren't you put one function inside of the other?  Is H2 find on Alice?  Yes, right. So age of Alice is equal to 90. So this is equal to K of 90.  Which is equal to a h.  Any questions about that?  These compositions you kind of you kind of read them from from right to left sort of in the opposite direction, right? Because the the rightmost function in a composition is the one that's going to be that you're going to plug into first. Okay, so it might be a little confusing but  Okay, so let's talk about a few properties that certain functions have there is a property called onto and it has this this logical meaning but we can talk about it more informally.  What I like to think of an onto function.  will have a  Well, basically map to the entire codomain.  an onto function  Maps  the domain to the entire  codomain  Okay, so let's try to decompose this logical statement. It says for all B. If B is in my codomain then that means there is there exists and hey that Mass to that be  questions  It's like you're not missing any of the codomain you're mapping to everything in the coda mean.  Okay, so the other two other kind of main property of functions that we want to talk about is called one to one.  and this is the function is one-to-one if  If it if it is never the case that you map to elements in the domain to one element in the codomain. So which one of these statements?  formalizes the definition of one-to-one  Can you can discuss it with your neighbor?  I keep on looking for my pain.  temperature in here  All right. Well, I guess it's just gone forever now.  Okay. What are you guys say?  Okay, this is not an easy problem.  Let's go through them.  Phone number for all and be if they're both in the domain then that means half of a is not equal to a half of be so there's a subtlety here. It's saying a is in the domain and B is in the domain. It didn't say that a is not equal to be right. So it's not always going to be the case that is not equal to half a b because what if a and b are the same thing so that kind of made give you a sense of why a is wrong.  How about be?  Okay. So for all A&B now, we have a and b are the domain and we have that F of a is equal to a half of be that implies that a is equal to B.  How does that one sound?  Remember what we're trying to avoid we want we want it so that it never is the case that two different elements from the domain map to the same element in the codomain. So we want is that whenever you have two elements have the same function value in the codomain you want those elements to be the same kind of what it's saying.  That's part. That's B.  Okay.  It's also it's also nice to think about it in the negative term. In fact, that's also a nice way to prove. So let's not in the negative term. I mean in the contrapositive terminology. So let's see. Let's see what that looks like.  Okay, it's going to be like this.  Hey.  Not equal to B implies that F of a not equal to f a b.  At least for me that makes a little bit more sense, even though it's the same meaning it's saying that if I have two different elements in the domain, I'm going to match them to two different elements in the codomain.  Any questions about that?  Any clarifications about CND?  heartless move on  so this is just the two different ways to think about it.  All right, good. Let's move on now this function.  Is it one to one is it onto is it well defined or is it?  Not either one to one around.  Okay, so  see here.  Okay, what kind of have C&D and Nae Nae? Okay, why don't you guys talked it over with yourselves and see if we can come to a consensus here?  If you have a question.  What's the definition of well-defined good question?  This is the definition of well-defined.  It's like what it means to do to define a function you have to have this so.  Another way to say well-defined is that there is a value.  The function is defined for every value in the domain.  They were seated sort of doing key.  Sounds good.  Okay, let some.  anybody have any comments they want to make  okay, so the answer is C.  Okay one to one and onto they're both Universal quantifiers. They're both for all statements which means that to disprove them. You just need to come up with something that you need one like counter example of why it doesn't work. Okay, so why is it not on to who can give me like one specific reason?  Right. There's nothing that maps to 2. So it's going to be on to everything in the codomain has to have a arrow going into it.  Okay, stop nothing nasty to that's the reason it's not onto. Okay. What's the reason that if not one to one?  okay, good 3  One to one. That's the reason why because two things are mapping into 3 K any questions  Is it well defined? Yes, what does it mean to be? Well defined basically.  Is it a well-defined function? Did it follow that statement? I made on the first slide few things to look for or basically there has to be if you have a image like this there has to be exactly one Arrow coming out of every element in the domain.  There can't be two there can't be zero there can't be five to have to be exactly one and that's sort of like the there exists unique part of that statement.  I'm sorry.  No, it's not continuous have to do with like the real numbers and if there's a small change in X there has to be a small change in y all that means is that the function is defined for every value in F.  I see me for every value in D.  Okay, how about this one?  f  is going from  the real greater than or equal to 0 to the real greater than equal to zero.  And here's the function assignment f of x is equal to x square. This one happens to be continuous, but we're not going to worry about continuity in this class. So is this function well-defined is it onto is at 121? Is it neither? Is it all these things?  stinker  are kind of have B & D onto and one-to-one onto but not one to one.  Okay, anybody want to make any comments?  Can you wonder whether the other negative number then negative one person have more than one square to up to input map into when you take off them Dakota face, right? But look at the Domain.  Write two negative numbers are not allowed in the domain.  No, that just means all non- reels non- reels.  Oh you thought it was like the our cross our cross Ariana. This just means non-negative real loud are all values possible.  Right are all values map to yes, even irrational numbers. Yes, right. So this is one to one and onto  There's a unique value for every X and every X can be or every y can be.  maps to  Okay, how about this one?  It looks exactly the same what's different?  Now non positive numbers. Okay. So F Maps  are non positive two.  are non positive  that was positive those are positive. Thank you.  That direction the alligator. Did you guys ever learn it that way?  alligator eats the bigger number  you didn't ask me to.  Okay, I kind of have a few things. It's either not well defined or 128 on onto and one-to-one. Has anybody have any comments?  Yes, and which one did you choose?  Yeah, it's not well defined.  for example  I mean just like the one to one and onto well-being well defined as a universal statement. So in order to show that is not well-defined. You just have to come up with one counterexample, right? So F of let's say  come on.  -1  is not defined.  Why is it not defined?  right because  half of -1 should be equal to 1 but that's not in the codomain.  Along with many many others that are not well defined, but you just have to find one that is not defined and then you're done questions.  Okay good.  let's move on Okay, so  Remember, we've also talked about defining functions recursively. Okay. So here is the function it is it Maps the set of all strings of 01?  Write to the set of natural numbers. Okay, so that means that you input as a string and outputs a natural number and what does it do? It basically tells you the length of the string.  In the way that we Define it is recursively because we know that the strings are defined recursively we can Define this function recursively using that structure. Okay. So we have a base case the length of the empty string is 0 right.  And the length of a string when you add zero to it.  Is equal to the length of the original string plus one cuz you just added one character and then same with one.  It's all it's really doing.  So my claim is that this function is onto.  How do we show that?  so  Since this is a universal.  Statement to be on to have to show it about every single element in the codomain. So one way around this that we don't have to do it for everything we could do a proof by contradiction.  assume  f is not onto.  Okay, so what would it mean if it's not on to?  Right. There's an output that doesn't get map to write.  So this means that  there exists an N in N  such that.  Half of w is not equal to end for all W in the domain.  Okay.  Why is this so wrong or is there is there a way that you could think for any and is there a way to build a string with a sequence of recursive steps so that you get to any number end?  Okay.  Absolute values the length of the string, right? So I'm telling you I'm saying listen, there's this number and it's big number n and I I dare you to make a string of that size. What are you going to tell me?  right, but so  I'm hoping that you say something like oh just applied rule one over and over end times and you'll build a string with n zeros.  I think therefore I found a string where the length is equal to end sort of the idea. That kind of makes sense.  So something like consider.  the string  W is equal to 0 0 0 up to 0 and x  then  Length of w is equal to in a few parts. I mean you have to show that that string is part of the set and to do that. You can use induction. You can just kind of go through and say well suppose I can make a string of length and -1 that means I can make a string.  Just kind of wanted to give you like a way to set up and onto proof because another thing that we read was that we should give you more examples of things that you're going to see in the homework. Okay? So this is how it is set up a general on to proof, but the the the details might be different.  Okay, let's go to 121. This function is not one to one. How do you show this?  What are you just want to find something in the codomain? You want a counterexample? You want to find something in the codomain that is map to buy two different elements in the domain.  Anybody have an example of that?  Okay, good. So  Half of 1 is equal to 1 1/2 of 0 is equal to 1 facts that disprove questions about that.  Say it again.  Oh, yeah.  Are the definitions the same we're just proving onto here and proving that is not one to one.  Okay good.  Let's look at another function. Okay, so we have sets and be a is 123 B is 2 4 6  Define a function from the power set of a to the power set of be by this.  This rule f of x is equal to X intersect B.  so  this is kind of a weird function that we haven't really seen like this before. It's a function that map's a set of sets to another set of sets. That means that the input to the function is a set itself an output of the function is a set itself. So this is where we get kind of, you know build upon that sets of sets.  Yes, right. I mean for any set X intersect B.  Is always going to be a subset of B.  right  So is it well defined? Yes.  because  because X intersect B is always going to be an element of the power set of B.  Any questions about that, right? And he said I guess I should say for all sets ask for any setbacks.  Write this the intersection of be with anything else is always a subset of B.  Okay, is this onto a question?  Matter what your birthday or do because empty sets always an element of the power set.  Okay, is this function onto?  The question you should be asking yourself is okay. Is there a subset of B that I can't map to?  One way to do. This would be to write out all the rules, right? How many rules will there be? Well, they'll be one rule for every element in the power set of a how many elements are there in the power set of a  It could write out all the rules.  I claim that there's no way.  There is no X such that.  Half of X is equal to 246.  246 is is in the power set of B. There's no way to get it. Right. There's no with any of the elements from the domain. There's no way to possibly get there.  That means it's not onto.  He questions about that.  Why why?  Okay, so what kind of set would need would X need to be?  So that X intersect B is equal to B.  I could even say this is the whole set B.  I guess I should say if I want to be like even more kind of clear here. I could say something like this. There is no x in power set of a  For which f of x is equal to?  He doesn't have two or four, right? There's no way to get them all together so that their intersection is the whole thing of B.  because every  for every element of a right or element of the power set of a  x x intersect B is in the codomain.  What is the fine for every element of the power set of a?  Now for the next one you're going to see that a lot of those elements map to the empty set, right?  More than one and so then this function is not on to either.  why not well  you have to give a counterexample half of empty is equal to empty and  F of I don't know what the second painting just one  is also empty.  Thank you found two different elements that map to the same element.  Any questions about that?  Okay house move on.  Okay, so we talked about functions we talked about one to one we talked about on two if a function has both of those properties one to one and onto is called a bijection or a one-to-one correspondence or it's called invertible the idea here. Is that every element in my code in my domain maps to a unique element in my codomain and every element of my codomain is map to so that means that I could go back and forth right? That means that if I have a bijection One Direction that means I have a bijection in the other direction to you can kind of flip it around.  And they're both one-to-one and onto so here is an example noticed that.  Everything every letter gets map to ABCDE.  and every number  only matched at Mass to a unique element  so  the statement for a bijection to be a bijection and needs to be  that that the function is one to one and onto  okay.  so  let's we're going to actually use this to Define what it means to be equivalent for two sets to have an equivalent cardinality in this kind of going to be the sort of topic of the next lecture. But before we get there, I wanted to talk about subsets.  Okay.  so  If which of the following is true? Okay, if a is a subset of B, then what can you say? Is there a function that's one to one from A to B. Is there a function that's on to from A to B. Is there a function that's a bijection from A to B. What is always going to be true?  Okay.  I think this may need a little bit of discussion here. Okay?  So most people are saying be if a is a subset of B, then there's an onto function from A to B.  What is a is a proper subset of B?  how are you going to map to the entirety of be from a smaller set a  right to be on to get the map to every single element in the codomain in b  so for example  If I had a was I don't know ABC and let's say B was a b c d e f. Is there any way that I can make a function from A to B?  Set maps to every single element and be.  I know right cuz be is too big. There's there's too many elements to get to Sol.  It's the same with this one because in order to be a bijection you need to be on to anyway, and I showed that it's not always the case that you're onto so what about a one-to-one function? Is it possible?  Okay, good f of x is equal to X will always be a one-to-one function.  right because  you're going to map a to a B2B and C2 C12 to find its 1 to 1.  When is the only time you can actually have an onto function?  Right if they actually equal then it's possible to have onto function.  Does opossum if they're equal it's also possible to make a function that's not on to write you just mad everything to one element Caso question.  So you could you can have an onto function that way. Yes, that's that's actually going to be the way that we Define greater than or less in terms of cardinalities. We're going to Define them in terms of one-to-one functions and onto functions.  Okay, so  yeah, I guess we'll stop there and  can you see San Diego podcast for more visit podcast. Ucf.edu? "
