  "Full Transcript": "Listen to a podcast.  Oh, yeah.  how to get to  this is a non yet, huh?  Oh, okay.  Okay, so let's get these lights.  bright presentation  me just see if I can get some sound on here commuted unmuted.  Choose your output device.  Okay, I hope this will work.  Okay, so  So today we're going to do is look at some divide and conquer examples, I'm going to try to share with you my  processes and how I design divide and conquer algorithms and you know, there's kind of like a little trick to it in anyway, and and there's sort of a  a way that students sometimes students get caught up in and I'll try to go through that as we go but what I really want you guys to do when you design these things is only think one level down what I mean by that is like for example merge sort  if you split the list into two then what's the next thing you do?  Well, if you say split into two again, you're not wrong, but if you go down that road that route you're going to get or when I if I do that I get very confused because then what are you do with those will they used to put all those into two and then just put all those into to all the way down instead? What I would like for you to do is think about only one level deep split into two then rehearse.  Frank and have faith that the algorithm won't give you what you want.  So as I was thinking about this lesson, it reminded me of this scene from a movie that I like. Have you guys ever seen this movie Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure?  so  I'll show you the clip that I'm talking about and then afterwards I'll try to kind of tell you why.  It's inspiration for me and it it it speaks to me in when you're designing an algorithm a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Okay, so let's just see if hopefully this sound will work here.  How do you get this thing to work?  Drake connect disconnect that thing  I know what I can do. I could just use the microphone to  Duet, okay, that's fine.  Okay, where's the speaker come out of this thing?  Okay.  Or did you go back in China when he had anesthesia?  I need to tell you what's happening in the movie. Sorry.  Okay, so these guys they got their hands on a time machine and so they went back in time and kidnapped a bunch of historical figures so that they could pass their history test. But what happened was all of the historical figures got thrown in jail, for some reason and one of these guys Ted the guy in the right his dad is the sheriff of the of the town. So he has the keys to the jail. So they're trying to break out all the prisoners all of the historical figures, but they don't have the key. Okay. So this is the way that they solve this problem is the way I think about solving Dynamic divide-and-conquer algorithms.  Get ready.  Skis good stealing, but he lost a few days ago.  When you come back in China when he had a missed you on this.  So what can we see? Don't got time. We can do it after the report.  Turn to thinking dude after the report with time travel back to 2 days ago still your Dad's keys and leave them here when we can't hear now. They'll be waiting for us.  Oh, yeah, so I have to report we can't forget to do this. Otherwise, it won't happen, but it did happen. Come on.  Okay.  What is that? Okay. I don't know what that was. Okay, so I don't know what that speaks to you or if you get what I'm trying to communicate with.  The idea is that the recursive calls are the keys. Okay, so don't worry about how to get them. Just just know that they'll be behind the sign for you when you want them. Okay, then once you get them and you would ever break out the the prisoners just make sure to go back and make sure you put it back there. Right? So think about it as like this time-travel kind of thing or at least that's how I do it. You guys can do it your own way. Okay. I'll try to  What will go through some examples and I'll give you a sense of why I think this is a good way to think of to do it. Okay, so here's an example of convex Hull. So the problem is to you have a bunch of points in the plane.  X Y coordinates and you want to you want to define the convex Hull of all the points?  Convex Hull is defined to be the smallest polygon that contains all the points. So for these points here. I just copied them over and I drew the convex Hall. Okay. Now for this for this presentation, I'm not going to go into all the details of the algorithm. I'm just going to kind of give you a sense of where the how to design at. Where the where the where does the design inspiration come from? Okay.  So before before you do that is not divide and conquer algorithm. It's nice to get a bass case, right? So the bass case if there are three or fewer points than what is the convex Hull.  Triangle right so it's the set of the points, right? Okay, so  you have three points.  The convex Hull is just the triangle. Okay, so if  And is equal to 3 return?  X1 y1  x 2y 2 and X 3y 3  They say you actually return the set of points that Define the hall.  Okay, so here's the Divide step.  How we going to divide the points?  I saw you like a a general rule of thumb.  When you're doing these kind of algorithms is just divided in half and try it out most of the time that's like the best way to do it. We've seen a few examples where there are more kind of interesting ways to divide. For example, when we did the selection we kind of divided by using a pivot like quicksort the fast Fourier transform kind of  Like unzipped it and divided it that way the cook to Niagara them divided into more than two things, but in general we just divide it in half, okay.  so  let's just divide it right down the middle. And remember this is just kind of like a very high-level presentation. So the real way you would do this would be to sort them by their x-values right and then divide it that way so you divide it in the middle now.  What's the next kind of Step of a design of a divide-and-conquer algorithm?  Don't say split it again.  Rehearse, right. So what do you expect to get out of the recursive call?  Two convex holes of each side. Okay. These are the keys hiding behind the door. I don't know how they got there. They're just they're okay so that you get you get that information for free and innocence.  And this might look daunting. And of course if you run the algorithm, it'll take some time cuz there's a there's a bunch of points there. But when you design it, don't worry about all the points only worried about what the result of the recursive call will be.  How did I get that stuff? Honestly, I haven't even figured out how to get it yet. I'm just assuming that I'm going to get it somehow. I'm assuming that after my report is done. I'm going to get back into my time machine go back in time and figure out how to do it. But for now it's there.  Okay, so  The is there a way that we can use this information to create a convex Hull of all the points.  How do you merge them?  right  That don't have it turning inward. So you would be physically threatening the top.  Okay, yeah.  That's a good way to kind of.  Imagine the putting them together you you connect them by what we call the tent the top tangent in the bottom tangent. Okay, and what those are are just lines and they connect  They connect these two points.  Okay. Now, how did I get those lines while you guys if you like as an exercise, you can you can play around with how you would actually do that. You can do it in linear time. I'll give you sort of up a high-level idea of how to do it question.  Yes.  Cuz it's got to be convex.  Here's another way to State the problem take all your points and think of them as like pins or like nails coming out of a board and take a big rubber band and put it all around the hole.  The whole mess of points and then release it and then wherever it kind of hugs the outer Nails, that's the convex call.  Okay. So one way to do this to kind of do this systematically.  is 2  Will just start with the the top tangent you take the two closest point together, which would be these two.  And you kind of do this step-by-step process where you you ghost you go?  counterclockwise  around the blue  reverse counterclockwise around the red  continue kind of your kind of jump from point-to-point until you until you make it out. I mean, this is a pretty simple.  example so you're going to get to it after like to iterations but  It's a little bit more complicated than that, but not much any questions.  So the idea is so the first the first generation would be okay. I'm choosing these two points and draw a line that goes  Through them right if this line crosses either of the polygons, then you know that it's not a tangent cuz it's an agent has to like have to not crossed a tall guy. So now I see that it crosses the blue one. So, you know it already it up and then you have kind of these two points.  Now this new line doesn't cross the blue one anymore. So now we'll we'll kind of rotate around the red one until you find a place kind of fun.  principal thing  will it always work in two dimensions?  Well, what if you had like?  Stop points that are the same.  but what if you had like  this is one of your  let's go like this.  This is one.  And then the other one looks like this.  Then this is your high as y value here, but you don't even use it, right?  I mean, there's like some weird edge cases that you really want a kind of do this circular thing to find them all but I don't know maybe you could start at the the top the the highest y values maybe that will get you kind of closer to what you need. But  okay, so let's finish this off. So we get those tangents by doing that thing you can imagine if it's a linear time.  Algorithm is actually going to be like a lot less than linear because the convex Hull is going to be a small subset of the set of points. But at most it'll be linear.  And then what you do is you basically just include you just kind of include all the points around and delete all these points from your answer. Right? So you basically merge the two subsets and you delete all those inner points.  Paint which is also kind of a very quick process and then that's what you get.  That's really all that's really as far as I'm going to go with this one. I'm not going to give you the code in the you can you guys can do that as exercise if you like any questions?  So before we move on I want to reiterate something about this whole thing which relates to Bill and Ted and kind of design aspect.  Remember this step is that we have the green or the red and the blue polygons and we use those to get those tangent points. But where did those polygons come from in the kind of?  As a designer, you just say you get them you have faith that they're going to be there and it's it's kind of like this magical thing because we're using something that we don't even know how to get yet. And if any of you went to discussion and did the closest pair of points that also has this this sort of  The sort of idea of using information that you don't even know how to obtain.  Okay, so let's move on. Okay here is kind of a simple algorithm. I want to basically input a number an integer n and I wanted to Output the two to the power end Okay, so  In decimal, it would be trivial if you wanted to do it in binary. Okay, so remember that  2 to the N has  kind of like around 3 and night and over three digits. Is that right?  Basically end-times what's log base 10 of 2?  like a third  something  Now it's a constant times an okay. So the size of to the end grows as and gross. Okay, so to the nscn digits, so we can't treat multiplication as a single step here because if and is a very large number really weird that we're going to be multiplying large numbers together.  Okay, but we can use our new multiplication algorithm that we did from before. Let's just use the X karatsuba.  That runs in Big O of n to the 1.5 something.  Okay, so what's the problem will be useful in Computing to the end?  Okay. Well just like before you want your problem to kind of.  Reduce in size by to instead of plugging an end what happens when you plug in an over to that's kind of the idea.  Against but don't forget your base cases. If any zero return one if it is 1 return to no big deal. Otherwise split the problem in half. Okay, so I'm going to name my algorithm pot power of 2 of end gives you to the end in binary. So what does p o t of n over to give you?  I'm sorry, this is Chippy decimal.  What does this give you?  2 p.m. Close  in decimal, but  To the end over to good.  Okay.  How do you know for sure that that p o t of n / 2 is going to give you to the end / 2 in decimal?  right  Perfect. Thank you. You really don't honestly, you don't know for sure. You're just going to  Assume that your algorithm works just like all this other kind of stuff.  okay, so here's here's the algorithm and I have it so that it  works for any even and odd so I take the floor of an over to this will give you two to the floor and over to  okay, I x karatsuba p with itself basically Square it right and so  if n is even  then  Andover to is actually equal to n over 2 and in that case p is equal to  2 to the N / 2  * 2 to the N / 2  which is equal to 2 to the end, so that's good.  and  if n is odd  then and over to floor is actually equal to n minus 1/2. And in that case p is equal to 2 to the N / N - 1 / 2 x to the N - 1 / 2 which is 2 to the N -1. So then you just got to add pee to itself you get to the end - 1 + 2 million - 1 is II to the end you guys can go through the details exercise.  Let's quickly. I mean we kind of just went through kind of how it works, but noticed that going through how it works. We sort of are.  Justifying why it why it works. So you'll often see that the runt the correctness proofs of divide and conquer algorithm are pretty straightforward. It's it's a straightforward kind of induction argument because remember induction and recursion the kind of follow the same rules the same pattern. Okay, so you have the bass cases.  And then you have your induction argument induction hypothesis, basically my algorithms going to work. Basically, I know that I'm going to find the keys behind the sign right? I believe that I will.  And then you just make sure everything else works, right if n is even if n is odd.  Okay.  How long is this going to take? Well, we have one.  recursive call  we have this the non recursive part.  Takes big O of n to the 1.58 time.  And so this will be our  recursion plug that into the master theorem you get what?  8 is equal to  right B is equal to  2D is equal to  So which case is it it's a is less than b to the D. And so that what is the total time T of n is Big O of  you guys need your note notes for this.  And to the 1.58 it's just end to the D.  Good questions.  Okay. So the last example we're going to do.  Well, this is just what it it's okay. That's fine. I kind of want us to do it together. Okay, so I'm going to be stopping a lot and having you guys really work on this. Okay, so maybe get out of piece of paper or have a have a neighbor get out of piece of paper and I really want us to Design This Together. Keep all the things in mind. Okay. So here's the idea you're given a list of intervals or you can think about them as like events right isn't same kind of input that we've seen before for like those greedy algorithm.  But now instead of wanting to avoid collisions or avoid overlaps. Now we want to find what is the greatest overlap between Pairs of intervals?  Okay. What is the overlap for the first let's see. What is an interval you can think about it as a discrete interval in this case, which would just be 16 to 23 would be just all the integers from 16 to 23 or you can think about it as a continuous interval. If you like that better all the real numbers in between in either case the overlap between two intervals. Is there intersection? Okay.  Given two intervals, how would you compute the length of their overlap? So  I'll give you guys like maybe one or two minutes. How would you compute the length of the overlap of a b and c.  Yeah for this for this one. This is in a this is not the divide-and-conquer part.  Really what I want you guys to do is come up with a simple formula.  Of how to compute them.  Maybe you could do it now. I wouldn't do this because you want the formula for this to be a constant time thing. You don't want it to depend on the length and it's possible to do that.  Okay. Does anybody have a way to do this?  OKC, okay, so we have a baby.  and CD  if C is less than b.  b o b license e  How do I delete?  activate AC on Echo PB - 950  that work  I guess I should say like let's do it like this.  else return  men of what was it meant of BD?  minus Max of AC  Just want to thank you.  Okay. So the point here is just that this is a a constant time thing the constant time operation you're just  You using the information about the endpoints? Not really what's inside you don't really actually have to take the intersection and count of all the things.  Okay. So now let's kind of look at some like an example K. What is the greatest overlap of these intervals 45 250 717-250-1029. So of course, this is not going to be easy to do just by looking at them, right so  Just so we can get like a more clear picture of what we're dealing with. I drew those intervals. Okay. Now if there's there's a few intervals here, you could probably figure out what's the biggest overlap just by kind of looking but let's let's let's start talking about a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Okay. So before we dive in I kind of want to give a  I want to try to solve this problem in like a Brute Force type of way just so that we have sort of a baseline algorithm. It's kind of a nice thing to do when you're designing something right because you can design The Brute Force it might not be so efficient. But at least you have a working algorithm and you can maybe use it to test often, you know, it's a good idea as a designer. So what's a simple solution for this?  Test all pairs good calculator overlap between all pairs return the maximum of all the pairs. How long does it take?  Okay, so hopefully our divide-and-conquer will beat that right?  Or I could just do that.  Okay. So these are the types of things. I like to think about when you when you build a divide-and-conquer algorithm compose your base case break the problem into smaller pieces recursively call the algorithm on the smaller pieces combine the results.  So this is like the key.  And this is like, okay go back in time.  And put the key there.  Okay, so composer bass case what happens if there's only one interval?  return  0  Good.  Okay. Otherwise, we're going to split it up.  Okay. So what I want you guys to do is talk maybe for like a minute or two.  Talk about how you would want to split up this problem.  Walking Dead  Okay. What are you guys say? How do you guys want to split it up?  and half like this  like the first set of intervals in the second set.  You don't like that.  Why not?  Yeah, we're going to run into problems here cuz it's not that it is wrong or won't work. It certainly will work. We get the intervals on the top half and the the biggest overlap in the top half because overlapping the bottom half but then when you do your combined step to figure out what is the biggest overlap among intervals from either half  Is going to take maybe and squared time cuz you have to compare every pair.  Compare and over to intervals with n over to other ones. Okay. So what maybe let's split it up in the more orderly way.  Maybe that's why.  Okay. Well, where do I cut the line?  by these numbers  so 30  but then it cuts a bunch of them. So what does it really mean to cut it in half? How how would you?  Describe it.  So you like them?  like this  But that might cut part of the overlap, right?  Hangover 2  Okay, good. I like that. Let's do that. So sorted by the starting time right or the left endpoint and then split it in half and over two and a number two guy so I sort it. So I those red and points are the left half and the blue and points are the right half.  Good now, what do we get from the recursive calls?  We got the length of  the overlaps of each side  so at this point while I'm designing it, I'm just going to write those things and I'm not going to try to  algorithmically compute them. Let's just kind of eyeball what they are. Okay, so it turns out that  This is the ones we get among the red intervals. The biggest overlap is 13 and among the blue intervals. The biggest overlap is  9 write this comes from overlapping  this guy with this guy, right and the red one comes from overlapping.  this guy  with this one, right?  These two how did I get those? I don't really know yet. But let's just assume that I get them.  Okay, so that's kind of like this recursive call. So you're overlapping on I mean you're calling your algorithm on these things and these are what you expect to get. Okay. Now what else must we consider?  We know the biggest overlap among the red ones among the blue ones. What what do we need to know now?  Right, if there's one that comes from the red and one that comes from the blue, maybe that could be bigger. Okay, so that's sort of the combined step in this case.  So that's kind of what I say here the greatest overlap overall, maybe contain entirely in one sub list the red or the blue or be an overlap of one interval from either side.  Okay, so let's think about what kind of information we have.  and use that to to combine these things Okay, so  What I want you guys to do now is come up with an efficient way to determine the greatest overlap of intervals or one is red. And the other is blue when I say efficient.  This has got to be better than in squared because of it is and squared you write out your recurrence.  and you get  T of n is equal to  Tootsie event / 2 + Big O of N squared you do the master theorem and you get T of n is big old and square guy. So you haven't really saved anything by doing it that way and you all can come up with and squared algorithm to do this, right? You just compare every pair. Okay. So now I want you to come up with a more efficient algorithm in square. Get ready go.  What you should you be using is the property that we've the way that we split it up is important here and use that use that to help gain your efficiency.  tourism.  Okay. Does anybody have a an idea of how to approach this?  Anybody get better than N squared?  All right do this as exercise then?  Strength to talk about on Friday.  I mean, I guess before you guys go at this point, we basically solve the problem. We haven't we have a working divide-and-conquer problem. What we're trying to do now is just get it to run more efficiently queso and sword the idea.  Looks correct. Well, I mean there's a way to get member this is like we can achieve this.  If I just comparing a repair, but I'm saying we can we can finish it off by comparing every red with every blue.  But that's not really getting gaining any efficiency. So what I'm asking for you guys to do now to see if you can come up with get a better gain a better efficiency.  Tacos the most to the to the flu and ask for and then we find the endpoint and that's where the flu that's before that and for the endpoint. We see how long it is. I found a love.  I love you.  Okay, how long is that going to take?  right  That's right.  UC San Diego podcast ",
